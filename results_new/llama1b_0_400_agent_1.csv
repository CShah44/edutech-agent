5,How do muscles grow?,"Muscle Growth 101

**Step 1: Get Ready to Grow!**
Muscles grow when you're doing more than your body can handle, like lifting weights or running a marathon. This is called progressive overload.

**Step 2: Be Patient (No Quick Fixes!)**
Growing muscles takes time, so don't expect overnight results. It's like planting seeds - they need to be nurtured and cared for before they grow into strong plants.

**Step 3: Get Your Inflammation On!**
When you get hurt or damage your muscles (like when you lift weights), it triggers inflammation, which is like a superhero that saves the day by fixing the problem.

**Step 4: Take Care of Your Body (Rest & Recovery)**
After muscle damage, your body needs time to fix and rebuild. This means taking rest days, eating healthy food, and getting enough sleep - it's like giving your muscles a spa day!

**Step 5: Fuel the Fire!**
Eating the right foods, like protein-rich meals, helps build new muscle tissue. It's like feeding your body the nutrients it needs to grow strong and healthy.

So, how do muscles actually grow? Here's the cool part:
- When you lift weights or do resistance training, you're causing micro-tears in your muscles.
- Your body responds by sending in repair crew members (like immune cells) to fix the damage.
- As they work their magic, new muscle fibers are built from scratch, making your muscles stronger and larger over time.","I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to ""feed"" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another day.",30.442281007766724,success,2026-01-20T22:07:29.451390,,0.32929782082324455,0.04379562043795619,0.13559322033898305,0.7161348462104797,0.7161348462104797,0.7161348462104797,0.0,18.577245712280273,0,0,0.0,Error: Expecting ':' delimiter: line 35 column 1 (char 330)

","Two things going on here. First, heat doesn't have anything to do with sunburn, it's all about UV rays. Encountering more UV rays = more sunburn. However, dark skin absorbs more UV rays than pale skin. And in fact that's exactly why it burns less. The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns (because it's the lower, reproducing cells that matter, the upper ones are disposable protection).

9,Why is chickenpox worse as an adult?,"Because chickenpox is usually mild as a child and not contagious to adults until later, adults who get chickenpox are more likely to experience severe symptoms, such as fever, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, adults may have weakened immune systems due to factors like aging, certain medications, or underlying health conditions, making them more susceptible to complications from the virus.","It's mostly due to the difference in immune system between a child and an adult. A primary varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic.  Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called ""shingles"" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection.",18.215633392333984,success,2026-01-20T22:45:48.874405,,0.25125628140703515,0.07106598984771574,0.1708542713567839,0.7332907915115356,0.7332907915115356,0.7332907915115356,0.7463623285293579,15.306754112243652,8,7,7.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct but misses some key points.

16,Why are the things that taste the best bad for us?,"You are what you eat, so choose wisely.

**1. Evolutionary factors**: Our bodies have been designed to thrive on a diet rich in nutrients from whole foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Processed foods often contain added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats that can confuse our taste buds and make us feel worse.

**2. Flavor compounds**: Certain flavor compounds, like those found in spicy or sour foods, are natural warning signs that something is good for us. On the other hand, bitter tastes often signal toxins or stressors in our diet.

**3. Emotional connections**: Food can evoke strong emotions and memories. Enjoying a favorite dish can bring joy and satisfaction, but overindulging can lead to guilt and regret.

**4. Balance your diet**: A balanced diet with variety is key. Eating too much of one thing can make it taste bad, while eating too little might leave you feeling weak or tired.

**5. Practice mindful eating**: Pay attention to what you're putting in your body. Savor each bite, and try not to rush through meals. This helps you connect with the food on a deeper level and enjoy its flavors.

**6. Choose whole foods over processed ones**: Whole foods tend to be more nutritious and less likely to cause inflammation or other negative effects on our health.

**7. Limit added sugars and saturated fats**: These two types of unhealthy fats can increase inflammation, which is linked to chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.

**8. Find healthy alternatives**: If you're craving something specific, try finding a healthier version that still satisfies your cravings. For example, if you love chocolate, try dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content instead of milk chocolate.

By understanding these factors, you can make informed choices about what you eat and how it affects your body.","Let's think about this from an evolutionary perspective. Way back in the day, (like way way way back) humans struggled for food just like every other animal. It was to our species evolutionary advantage to pursue food that would keep us full longer, or provide more energy than other food options. Fats, are 9 calories per gram compared to proteins and carbs that are 4 calories. Humans that preferred fats and craved them, had a higher chance of survival and passing on the fat craving trait.

22,Why people like getting drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced ?,"[Social Bonding, Dopamine Release] 

Explanation:
People often get drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced due to a combination of social bonding and dopamine release.

**Social Bonding:** Drinking can create a sense of camaraderie and shared experience among friends. When people are together, drinking becomes a way to bond over their experiences, laugh, and have fun. It's like a big ol' group hug, but with booze.

**Dopamine Release:** Drinking triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation. When we experience something pleasurable, our brains send signals that say, 'Hey, great job!' And then there's the crash – when the party's over, and our brains are all, 'Uh-oh, time to wind down.' This can lead to a cycle of seeking out more pleasure through drinking.

In summary, people get drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced because it creates opportunities for social bonding and triggers dopamine release – a natural high that makes us want to do it all again.",Because only when you're passed out in a puddle of your own vomit can you silence the ennui and existential hum.

41,How does bugspray kills bugs?,"Bugspray Kills Bugs with 4 Different Methods

Let's break it down in simple terms:

1. DEET disrupts insect nervous system
   Imagine your bug's brain is like a video game console - it needs to be turned on to do its job. DEET is like a special button that turns the console on, but for too long, it keeps running without stopping, causing bugs to get confused and lose control.

2. Picaridin works similarly to DEET
   Picaridin is another insecticide that does the same thing as DEET - it disrupts the bug's nervous system, making them feel uncomfortable and eventually die.

3. Permethrin kills insects through disruption of nervous system
   Permethrin is a special kind of chemical that targets the bug's nervous system, causing it to shut down and eventually die. It works like a super-strong stun gun for bugs!

4. OLE repels insects through strong scent
   Believe it or not, some bug sprays use a strong scent to repel bugs - it's like wearing a special perfume that keeps them away! This is because the smell of certain chemicals can be really unpleasant for bugs and keep them from coming near.

In summary, bugspray uses four different methods to kill bugs: DEET disrupts their nervous system, picaridin does the same thing, permethrin targets their nervous system, and OLE repels them with a strong scent. It's like using a combination of tools in your bug arsenal - each one helps keep those pesky insects at bay!","Bugspray is actually a chemical weapon.

 insulation is super important to keep the heat in and let it out slowly.

 Glass doors help reflect radiant heat back into the cooking compartment,
 rather than letting it escape through the clear glass. Think of it like a mirror, but without any shiny surface!
 The matte finish on oven doors also reflects some of that radiant heat back in, making your cooking space warmer and cozier.
 Cooking compartment lights can add to this warmth by providing a warm glow inside the oven.

46,Why does metal react so violently when microwaved?,"Metal reacts violently when microwaved because of a concept called 'balance' and 'strategic planning'. When metal is heated, it expands. Imagine you're holding a balloon and then suddenly letting go - the balloon will inflate rapidly. This is similar to what happens with metal. As the metal heats up, its atoms vibrate more vigorously, causing it to expand and become less dense than its surroundings. This imbalance creates pressure inside the metal, which can lead to violent reactions.","The way microwaves work is through jiggling charged/polar particles in your food (the water primarily). This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another.  Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike.",1165.586487531662,success,2026-01-21T00:50:10.254863,,0.29508196721311475,0.04132231404958677,0.13934426229508196,0.6687915921211243,0.6687915921211243,0.6687915921211243,0.0,25.794755935668945,2,3,4.0,The generated answer is partially correct but lacks clarity and detail.

55,Why doesn't it rain salt water?,"The Earth just doesn't produce enough moisture to make rain from salt water. Here are the reasons why it doesn't happen:
","When water evaporates, it gets heated to an extent that the water particles move faster and spread apart, which causes them to become ""lighter"" than the air around them, turning into water vapor, a gas. Due to this, they rise up into the atmosphere. Then, they start to cool down, and become liquid again. When they become cool enough that they're heavier than the air, it rains back down. This is the basic water cycle. The salt which makes it salt water requires a much higher temperature to turn into gas, one which doesn't normally happen during this cycle.

63,What happens to your brain when you space out?,"When you space out, your brain is like a computer trying to do too many things at once. It's like it's trying to solve a million math problems all at the same time! (Or maybe just one really hard problem that nobody can figure out). When this happens, some of its tiny roads called 'neural connections' get a little mixed up. This is bad news because our brains need those neural connections to work properly. If they get messed up, we might feel confused or even lose focus. It's like trying to watch Netflix and play video games at the same time - it just doesn't work! When you're under stress or feeling overwhelmed, your brain tries to cope by zoning out (or space out). This is a natural thing that some people do when they need to relax, but if you're doing it too much, it can lead to problems like trouble sleeping, making decisions, and even affecting your mood. So, while space-outing might seem like a cool way to chill, excessive use of this coping mechanism can have negative effects on our brains. It's essential to find healthy ways to manage stress and pressure, rather than relying solely on the 'space out' method.","There are two kinds of spacing out. There is background processing - thinking about stuff that isn't apparent to you consciously, and basically resting your mind.

67,How do people add colour so accurately to black and white photos?,"In photography, adding color accurately to black and white photos is crucial because it enhances the overall mood and atmosphere of the image. Color grading can also create unique looks and moods by manipulating the colors in a way that wasn't there originally. To achieve accurate color representation, photographers use various techniques, including desaturation (removing or reducing certain colors) and tinting (adding specific hues). Desaturation helps to add depth and interest to images by removing details from certain areas of the photo, creating a more muted tone. Tinting adds a touch of warmth or coolness to an image, depending on the color used, which can completely change its mood. By combining these techniques, photographers can create complex and visually appealing effects that make black and white photos truly come alive.","It's basically painting a transparent picture on top of the black-and-white, and the B/W image provides much of the shading.  In the days before photoshop, you had actual transparent inks with limited tints to choose from, and that's why old hand-colorized photos often look more cartoony. Now, you can pick from a vast range of colors until it more or less matches what you would expect: a white person with fair hair will probably have skin in X color range, unpainted wood furniture is going to be a shade of brown, jeans are almost certainly blue, a military uniform from that era is going to be this particular color, etc.  Plus if you have experience with B/W photography you might have a sense for how some colors will translate to film; they often have a particular range of grey due to the characteristics of a given film.

72,why does spicy food make me sweat?,"Spicy food makes you sweat because of a chemical reaction called capsaicin that happens when it comes into contact with your tongue and other parts of your mouth. This reaction releases histamine, which is like a special messenger that tells your body to break down the capsaicin and make more sweat glands work overtime. As histamine works its magic on your skin, it causes blood vessels near the surface of your skin to widen, or dilate, allowing more blood to flow in. This increased blood flow makes you feel hot and thirsty, which is why people often reach for water when they eat spicy food - they're trying to cool down their body! ","""The answer hinges on the fact that spicy foods excite the receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat. Those receptors are pain fibers, technically known as polymodal nociceptors.

""Animals try so hard to survive because they have a strong instinctual drive to do so.

This is especially true for animals that are raised in captivity, like Lele's family with their chickens and ducks. They have learned to find ways to survive and even succeed despite knowing it might not last long.
""This instinctual drive can be so powerful that they'll do just about anything to stay alive, including finding food, avoiding predators, and taking care of themselves in some way.

Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen (due to certain illnesses), your scars' wounds can actually reopen.

When the price of oil increases, the demand for gasoline decreases, leading to a decrease in the price of gasoline. However, when the price of oil decreases, the demand for gasoline does not increase as much, resulting in a slower decrease in the price of gasoline.

102,how they catch digital pirates who use hotspots or do they?,"{""Explanation:
""Digital pirates can be caught through IP blocking, device blacklisting, and behavioral flags.
""These methods help identify users who are using hotspots or other suspicious activities.
""IP blocking targets specific locations from accessing the internet,
while device blacklisting identifies devices that have been known to pirate content in the past.
""Behavioral flags flag users who exhibit unusual behavior, such as frequently using VPNs or other anonymization tools.
""These flags are often set by network providers and can be used to block access to pirate sites or identify users who are engaging in illegal activities.
""By combining these methods, networks can effectively catch digital pirates and keep their customers safe from piracy.
""In addition to IP blocking and device blacklisting, networks may also use behavioral flags to detect pirate activity. By using a combination of these approaches, networks can create a robust system for catching digital pirates and keeping their customers safe online.
""For example, a network might block access to pirate sites that are known to be frequently visited by users who have been flagged as pirates in the past. This approach ensures that users who are caught pirating content are also blocked from accessing other potentially malicious sites or services.

Certain words automatically make your brain think of a subject in a more intense way than others. A colloquial term vs a scientific one. This is true for pretty much anything, even if it isn't a swearword -- sweat vs perspiration, for example. When it's a topic that's taboo, that word becomes a swear.

129,why you can't put metal in the microwave but nothing happens to the metal that it's built from,"{""Magnetic fields:** When you put metal in a microwave, it gets affected by the strong magnetic field of the microwaves. This can cause the metal to rotate or even move around inside the container, but unfortunately, this doesn't change its temperature or properties.

""Electromagnetic interference:** Microwaves interact with other electromagnetic fields, including those from nearby metal objects. In your case, the microwave oven's magnetron produces a strong magnetic field that can interfere with the microwaves passing through the metal container. This interference can cause the metal to heat up or even melt.

""Dielectric properties:** Metal is an excellent dielectric material, meaning it can store electric energy efficiently. However, when heated by microwave radiation, the electrons in the metal start moving rapidly and randomly, causing the material's dielectric properties to change. This can lead to increased resistance, heat dissipation, or even a fire.

""Conductive vs. insulating characteristics:** Metal is an excellent conductor of electricity, but it's not an insulator like plastic or glass. When heated by microwave energy, metal becomes an excellent conductor, allowing the microwaves to pass through and cook the food inside. However, this also means that the metal can heat up quickly and potentially cause a fire.

""Microwave energy absorption:** Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing radiation with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz. When you put metal in a microwave oven, it absorbs some of these microwaves, causing them to be redirected or scattered. This can lead to hotspots, burning, or even explosions if not used properly.

","You can put metal in microwaves, which is a lot come with racks, you just can't put metal with sharp edges/points such as forks and aluminum foil.

139,How do spammers spoof a cell phone number to make scam calls?,"Spammers use various methods to spoof cell phone numbers, making it difficult for you to identify genuine calls. Here's how they work in simple terms:

1. **Choosing the right number**: Spammers pick a number that looks similar to your own, but isn't actually yours. This is called a 'spoofed' number.
2. **Making it look legit**: They might add numbers from popular phone brands or services (like Verizon) to make their spoofed number appear more legitimate.
3. **Using caller ID tricks**: Some spammers use fake caller IDs that show a specific area code, but when you call back, the real number appears instead.
4. **Spoofing the time and date**: They might also change the time and date on their computer to make it look like they're calling from your location.
5. **Using a 'honeypot' tactic**: Some spammers set up a fake phone number that looks similar to yours, but when you call them back, they leave a message saying they got your number in their database (i.e., the spammer has it). This way, they can catch people who might be interested in buying something from them.

By being aware of these methods and taking precautions, you can protect yourself from unwanted calls and scam attempts.","When you make an outbound call, the calling system gives the phone system the caller ID information. The reason this can be (legitimately) different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number (this way you’re not giving out the direct number unless you needed to).  The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID.  The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things.",17.029942274093628,success,2026-01-21T04:14:39.462778,,0.39886039886039887,0.07449856733524356,0.16524216524216526,0.7619980573654175,0.7619980573654175,0.7619980573654175,0.0,13.278543472290039,8,9,8.5,"The generated answer provides accurate and comprehensive information about how spammers spoof cell phone numbers to make scam calls.

158,How bars or clubs charge huge crowds of people randomly ordering drinks.,"Here's an explanation of how bars charge huge crowds using various techniques:

1. **Pre-bookings**: Some bars allow you to book a table or drinks for a set time, which helps them manage the crowd and reduce wait times.
2. 
3. **Staff Scheduling**: The bar staff might be scheduled to work during peak hours, ensuring they have enough help when needed.
4.  **Queue Management Systems**: These systems can help the bar keep track of how many people are waiting in line and move them through efficiently.
5.  **Bar Area Design**: A well-designed bar area can make it easier for customers to order drinks without feeling overwhelmed or rushed.
6.  **Drink Ordering Systems**: The bar might use a system where you order your drink when the bartender is free, reducing wait times.
7.  **Bartenders' Expertise**: Bartenders are trained to handle crowds and can expertly manage orders and service during peak hours.
8.  **Technology Integration**: Some bars use technology like mobile apps or online ordering systems to streamline the process of ordering drinks and managing the crowd.

160,"If each pixel is merely a combination of a red, blue, or green light, why don't colorblind people who can, for example, not see red or green colors, only see blue on computer monitors?","{""Explanation for Colorblind People:
""Colorblindness is a condition where a person has trouble seeing certain colors because their eyes don't work correctly.

In people with colorblindness, the problem isn't that they can't see colors at all, but rather that their brains have trouble interpreting the signals sent to them by the light.

When light from an object enters your eye, it hits a specialized cell called a photoreceptor (rods and cones) in the retina. The rods are better at detecting movement and changes in brightness, while the cones are better at detecting colors.

People with colorblindness usually have only one type of cone that's affected, which means they can't see certain colors like red and green. But they might still be able to see shades of blue and other colors that aren't affected by their cone problem.

So why do colorblind people who can't see red or green on computer screens often look at them as blue? It's because the screen is using a different type of light source, usually white light, which stimulates both the rods and cones in equal amounts. As a result, even though they can't see red and green colors, their brains are still getting the signals that tell them it's blue.

This means that colorblind people who use computer screens can often distinguish between different shades of blue and other colors, just like anyone else.",It's not that colour-blind people can't see red or green. They can see them both fine; they just can't tell them apart.,15.961413621902466,success,2026-01-21T04:54:34.224526,,0.15789473684210525,0.06818181818181818,0.12781954887218047,0.6534869074821472,0.6534869074821472,0.6534869074821472,0.0,9.50385570526123,9,8,8.0,"The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of colorblindness and how it affects the perception of colors on computer screens.

168,Why does water taste bitter after eating pineapples?,"When you eat pineapple, the enzyme bromelain breaks down the tough fibers and proteins in the fruit. This process makes the food easier to digest, but it also changes its chemical makeup. When bromelain is broken down into smaller compounds, it releases a compound called brominated esters of malic acid. These compounds are responsible for the bitter taste you experience after eating pineapple. Additionally, when stomach acid comes into contact with these brominated esters, they release more active compounds that bind to receptors in your tongue, making the taste even more unpleasant. This is why water tastes bitter after eating pineapple.","When the water hits your taste buds, they are stimulated a little. The problem is they have been overloaded with sugar and acid, thus they are temporarily unable to *report* sugar and acid at that moment.

","**NOT ELI5** The car's driveshaft also powers a *speedometer cable*, which spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the *speed cup*. This magnet rotates continually in an equal direction.

It attempts to catch up with the speed of the magnet. a *hairspring* stops this, so it only rotates a little. This small motion moves the dial on the speedometer a little. The stronger the current, the faster the cup rotates, the further the speedometer's dial moves.  & nbsp; **ELI5** The driveshaft powers a speedometer cable, which leads to a magnet rotating inside a cup.

174,Why is it when I drink a glass of liquid I urinate at least twice as much back out?,"When you drink a glass of liquid, your body tries to get rid of excess water by urinating more frequently. This is because your kidneys are trying to balance out the amount of water you take in with the amount of water you produce. When you drink a lot of liquid, your kidneys have to work overtime to process it all and eliminate excess water. As a result, they release more urine into your bladder, which can lead to increased urination throughout the day.","Your bladder only sends the ""time to pee"" message to your brain when it reaches a certain level of fullness. So the amount you pee out doesn't just represent the glass of water you just drank, but all of the water you have drank since the last time you peed plus the water your body needed to dissolve the waste products it excretes in urine (urea, creatine and some other compounds).",13.292495489120483,success,2026-01-21T05:33:34.115224,,0.41025641025641024,0.0909090909090909,0.20512820512820512,0.7176326513290405,0.7176326513290405,0.7176326513290405,0.0,9.337787628173828,8,7,7.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct but misses some key points.

As the microwaves penetrate the tray, they cause the metal to generate an EMF that creates a magnetic field around the tray. This magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, causing the tray to rotate.

177,why child support is based on income rather than what a child would need monthly.,"Child support is calculated differently because it's not just about how much money a parent has, but what their child really needs to survive and thrive.

Think of income like the amount of money you have available for other things. But what a child actually needs can vary greatly from one family to another.

For example, if one parent is a stay-at-home mom with two kids, they might need more financial support than a single dad who works outside the home and has only one kid. This is because stay-at-home moms often have expenses like food, diapers, and childcare that aren't included in their income calculations.

Additionally, families with higher incomes may be able to provide more for their children than those with lower incomes. So, even if a single parent has a lot of money, they might not be able to afford everything their child needs without some kind of support.

But here's the thing: some states are starting to rethink this approach and focus on what really matters – providing for your child's basic needs like food, shelter, clothing, and education. These alternative approaches aim to ensure that children receive the support they need to thrive, regardless of their parents' income or financial situation.","Child support is partially based on income. It is also partially based on the number of children and their age, the cost of basic living expenses and school in that general area, and whether or not any special needs are present. Which sometimes leads to a very high ratio, but that is also something that can happen when both parents live with their children; not all jobs pay a wage that covers a child's reasonable expenses.

191,How can there be a sex wage gap in the US if we've had the Equal Pay Law since 1960?,"{""Explanation:
""The US has had an Equal Pay Law since 1963, but despite this, the sex wage gap persists.
"" Key factors contributing to this include:
""1. Lack of enforcement: The law doesn't always lead to real change because it's not enforced consistently across industries and workplaces.
""2. Complexity of industries: Certain jobs are more complex or require specialized skills, making it harder for women to find fair pay.
""3. Societal attitudes and biases: Many people still hold implicit biases against women in certain professions or roles, leading to unequal pay.
""4. Education and training opportunities: Women often lack the same education and training as men, which can lead to lower salaries.
""5. Implicit bias: Unconscious stereotypes and biases can affect how employers evaluate job candidates and determine pay.
""6. Workplace culture: Some workplaces may have a culture that tolerates or even encourages unequal pay, making it harder for women to advocate for fair compensation.
""7. Industry-specific factors: Certain industries, like tech or finance, may be more likely to have higher-paying jobs with less emphasis on traditional gender roles, which can perpetuate the gap.
""8. Lack of transparency and accountability: Without clear metrics and reporting requirements, it's difficult to track progress and hold employers accountable for fair pay.
""9. Cultural norms around work-life balance and caregiving responsibilities: Women may face unique challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, leading to unequal pay for similar work.
""10. Historical context: The wage gap has been present since the 1960s, but it's only recently become a major issue due to increased awareness and activism.
""11. Systemic inequalities: The wage gap is often tied to broader systemic issues like pay discrimination, lack of job opportunities, and unequal access to resources and networking opportunities.
""12. Limited data collection: Until recently, there wasn't enough data available to track the wage gap accurately, making it harder to identify its scope and severity.
""13. Unconscious assumptions about women's work: Many employers still assume that certain jobs are inherently more ","There's a bit of a misconception about the wage gap. For jobs in the exact same role with the exact same responsibilities, the wages are about the same. However, men tend to be more likely to be promoted to higher-paying positions. Women are also more likely than men to take extended time off or work part time while raising a family, meaning their careers are held back during that time.",20.43756604194641,success,2026-01-21T06:00:31.822854,,0.1951219512195122,0.0392156862745098,0.1024390243902439,0.722722053527832,0.722722053527832,0.722722053527832,0.9251673221588135,10.773565292358398,8,9,8.5,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive and factually accurate explanation for the persistence of the sex wage gap in the US, despite the existence of the Equal Pay Law since 1963.

195,Why do American cities often have to take large public transport projects such as light rail and metro system to the voters but don't have to do the same for massive highway and road construction?,"There are several reasons why American cities often have to take public transport projects like light rail and metro systems to voters, but don't have the same push for massive highway and road construction:
","Large road projects usually exist to keep the existing road network running, or to improve its relation to the rest of the city.

208,Why does inbreeding cause the offspring to have a significantly lower IQ than average? What is the science behind it?,Genetics helps us understand how we're related to others.,"take it that a human body has 2 sets of genes. When a baby is made, half the genes are from the mother and other half is from the father. These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases.  Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically (or is milder). If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformations.",1397.1364090442655,success,2026-01-21T07:38:04.117734,,0.04705882352941177,0.0,0.023529411764705885,0.5496213436126709,0.5496213436126709,0.5496213436126709,0.0,36.945491790771484,2,3,4.0,"The generated answer does not provide a correct or complete explanation of why inbreeding can cause lower IQ.

210,Why can't modern houses be economically independent with solar + battery+ a little backup generator just incase?,"Here's an ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) explanation to help you understand why modern houses can't be economically independent with solar + battery + a little backup generator just in case:

**1. High upfront costs**: Building a solar panel system and installing batteries requires significant investment. The cost of solar panels, inverters, batteries, and other equipment can range from $15,000 to $30,000 or more per home.

**2. Intermittent nature of solar power**: Solar energy is generated only when the sun is shining, which means you'll need backup power during periods of low sunlight or at night. This requires a separate generator, like a gas or diesel engine, which can be expensive to run and maintain.

**3. Backup generation needs**: Even with solar panels, you still need a reliable source of electricity for critical loads like refrigeration, air conditioning, and medical equipment. A backup generator provides this essential power during outages.

**4. Energy storage limitations**: Batteries have limited energy storage capacity, which means they can only hold a certain amount of charge before needing to be recharged. This limits the amount of time you can rely on your solar-battery system without needing additional generation or charging.

**5. Grid connection and reliability**: Many utility companies still offer grid-tie options for homes with solar panels, which means they'll sell any excess energy back to the grid. However, if your home is not connected to the grid or has a high demand rate, you may need to rely on backup generation to meet your energy needs.

**6. Efficiency and grid connection requirements**: Modern solar panel systems are designed to be efficient, but they still require connection to the grid to sell excess energy. This means your home will likely receive credits for any surplus energy produced, reducing the financial incentive to generate all your own power.

With these challenges in mind, building a reliable and efficient energy system requires careful planning, research, and consideration of these factors. By understanding the pros and cons of solar+battery+backup generation, you can still build a modern house that's economically independent from traditional grid electricity.","A) You need a large array of solar powers to provide full coverage to the home (large initial cost, requires a lot of surface area, potentially takes away from the visual appeal of the home) B) until very recently, there hasn't really been any cost-effective battery solution for homes (Tesla Powerwall is helping to change this) C) Most people who live in developed countries don't have to worry about power outages because they are extremely rare. In these countries, it doesn't make sense to install solar panels just as an emergency backup... you would only do the install if your intention was to go off-grid so you don't have to pay a monthly electric utility bill (and/or because you can sell excess electricity back to the grid / power company to potentially earn money).",32.185224533081055,success,2026-01-21T07:49:55.319707,,0.29435483870967744,0.05263157894736842,0.125,0.7807673215866089,0.7807673215866089,0.7807673215866089,0.0,14.197059631347656,8,9,8.0,"The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the challenges associated with building an economically independent modern house using solar + battery + backup generator.

""The NFL lockout was a labor dispute between the National Football League (NFL) and the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), which lasted from July 2003 to February 2011.
""The main reason for the lockout was the NFL's refusal to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
""One of the key issues was revenue sharing. The NFL wanted a larger share of television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales, while the NFLPA demanded a greater share.
""The NFL argued that this would lead to increased costs and reduced profitability for teams and players alike.
""
""In July 2003, the two sides reached an agreement, but it was short-lived. In August 2004, the lockout began when the NFL refused to approve the NFLPA's proposal for a new CBA.
""The lockout lasted for over six years, causing significant disruptions to the sport.
""
""In February 2011, the lockout ended with a tentative agreement that included some concessions from both sides. However, the new CBA was not ratified by the players until August 2011.
""The NFLPA ultimately accepted the new CBA, but many players felt that it did not adequately address their concerns about revenue sharing and other issues.
""
""In total, over $2 billion in player salaries were lost due to the lockout. The dispute had a significant impact on the sport, including declining television ratings and attendance at games.
""
""The NFLPA ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2011, citing the financial losses suffered during the lockout.
""
""In 2016, the NFLPA reached a new collective bargaining agreement with the league, which included significant concessions from both sides. The agreement was ratified by the players in August 2017 and has been renewed annually since then.

222,why are there no comedy categories at the Oscars,"There are no comedy categories at the Oscars because:

1. Back in the day, the Academy was started with comedians and actors who won Oscars for their work.
2. Comedies just don't really get a wide following - people might like some funny movies but others aren't into laughs.
3. The Oscars have traditionally been about serious films that make big bucks.
4. Comedy is pretty subjective, which means it's hard to pick winners who are the best in this field.
5. Other genres like drama and action get more attention and recognition.","Each awards show has their own thing. You're probably aware of the Oscars and the Emmy, but there are like a hundred others with their own style and categories.  However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit (and add some flair and promo to the show) by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas (such as animated, comedy's, and sci-fi films), but this is still pretty new.

The short version is that the key used to *encrypt* the data is not the same as the one to *decrypt* it. When Alice sends something to Bob, she encrypts it with his *public* key. This is a key that everyone has the right to see and access. Only Bob, who has the only copy of his *private* key, can then decrypt the message. He then sends a reply, encrypting with Alice's public key, and she decrypts with her private key. The same sort of thing happens with an SSL transaction (HTTPS). When you connect to a secure site, you know you have the right site because they have a certificate proving they are who they say they are. That certificate is also the public key, so you send the data encrypted with that key, and only that site can decrypt it.

The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder.  In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely.  There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off.

238,How do hair transplants work?,"Hair transplants are a way to grow new hair in areas where it's thinning, balding, or missing. Here's how they work in simple terms:

1. **Healthy hair follicles are taken**: A surgeon carefully extracts individual healthy hair follicles from one part of the body (like the back of your head) and places them into another area you want to grow new hair (like the front or top section).

2. **The transplanted hair heals**: The extracted follicles are gently placed into their new home, where they start to produce new hair. This process takes about 3-6 months.

3. **The transplanted hair is evaluated**: After a few months, your surgeon will evaluate the transplanted hair to make sure it's growing normally and not causing any problems (like uneven growth or hair loss).

4. **Repeat as needed**: If you want more hair, you can repeat the process with new follicles taken from another part of your body.

5. **Results are long-lasting**: With regular maintenance (like trimming and shaving), the transplanted hair should look and feel like natural hair over time.","Hair from the back and side of your own head is used. It's not affected by male pattern baldness. They take individual hairs or groups and place them on your bald areas. To get more complex, this hair is unaffected by DHT which causes MPB hair loss.

255,How exactly do Saline pools work?,"{""Saline pools are a type of saltwater pool that use electrolysis to sanitize water, producing chlorine as a byproduct.
"" Electrolysis is the process where an electric current passes through water, breaking down its molecules into individual ions. In this case, the ions help to kill bacteria and other microorganisms.

The sanitizing reaction occurs when the electric current passes through the solution, causing the salt (sodium chloride) to break down into sodium and chlorine. This process is similar to how batteries work, but instead of producing energy, it produces a disinfectant that kills germs and bacteria.

Chlorine production is an important part of the sanitizing reaction. When chlorine is produced, it is released into the water, where it helps to kill any remaining microorganisms. The resulting solution is then pumped into the pool for use by swimmers.

The benefits of saline pools include gentler skin and hair due to the lower pH level, which reduces irritation caused by harsh chemicals. Additionally, the reduced chlorine levels make them a safer option for people with sensitive skin or eyes. Finally, the increased safety comes from the fact that the electrolysis process produces a disinfectant that is less likely to cause eye irritation compared to traditional chlorine pools.

Overall, saline pools offer a unique combination of benefits, making them an attractive option for pool owners looking for a gentler and safer alternative to traditional saltwater pools.","Salt water pools still use chlorine, the difference is that the chlorine is produced through electrolysis using the salt as the base material. The advantage is that the salt electrolysis process creates free chlorine ions (the type of chlorine that kills bacteria) and burns off chloramines (the type of chlorine that burns your eyes and smells like strong bleach). As long as they are maintained they will work just as well at killing bacteria, and people tend to find them less irritating, especially if they have sensitive skin. The salt system also has the benefit of ""softening"" the water.

258,how come we don't yet know the perfect diet for humans?,"We don't know the perfect diet for humans because of the many challenges involved. Here's a simplified breakdown of why we need to keep working on it:

1. **Human biology is crazy complex**: Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells, and each cell has its own unique needs. It's like trying to find the perfect recipe for every single person - it just doesn't work.

2. We don't fully understand how our bodies process food yet:
  * Metabolism: How your body breaks down and uses different nutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) is still not super clear.
  * Nutrient interactions: How different foods affect each other and you individually is a mystery.

3. Lifestyle factors are huge:
  * Diet quality vs. quantity: It's easy to eat healthy when you have access to good food, but it's hard when you're busy or don't know where to start.
  * Environmental influences (food safety, pesticides, etc.): These can all impact your health and make it harder to stick to a diet.

4. We still need more research:
  * Long-term studies: Finding the right balance between short-term benefits and long-term risks is tricky.
  * New technologies: Developing accurate food labels and tracking nutritional data is a major challenge.

5. Innovation will help us get closer to perfection:
  * Personalized nutrition: Using genetic info, health data, and other factors to tailor diets just right.
  * Precision nutrition: Focusing on specific nutrients or health goals to make diets more effective.
  * Functional foods: Exploring new ways to use food as medicine (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics).

6. More research is needed:
  * Nutrigenomics: Studying how genetics affect what we eat and our bodies respond to different nutrients.
  * Long-term studies: Continuing to track the effects of diets on health over time.

Overall, it's a complex puzzle with many moving parts. But by continuing to innovate, research, and work together, we'll get closer to finding the perfect diet for humans.",There isn't one.

This is like a big circle where the hot water rises to the top, cools down in the sink area, and then returns to the bottom of the tank to warm up again. The continuous loop absorbs thermal energy from the surrounding environment, which increases the temperature of the shower water. Additionally, the pressure difference between the tank and the pipes under the sink also helps distribute heat more evenly, ensuring that the shower water stays hot throughout the whole process.","your water heater heats water to anywhere from 120 to 180 degrees F.

272,"Why can't governments print ""temporary"" money to cover important expenses?","Because governments cannot print temporary money, it can lead to serious economic problems like inflation, currency devaluation and loss of trust.

Excessive money printing can cause the value of money to decrease, making it less valuable than what you're paying for things. This is called inflation.

When people have too much money circulating, businesses may raise prices because they know there's more money available. This can lead to higher costs and lower standards of living.

Additionally, excessive money printing can cause the currency to lose its value over time. Imagine holding a dollar bill in your hand - if it starts to lose its worth, what good is that?

In extreme cases, governments may even have to print more money just to keep up with their expenses, leading to a complete loss of control and economic instability.

And finally, excessive money printing can erode the trust people have in their currency. If everyone's losing faith in the value of money, it can be very difficult for businesses and governments to function effectively.

So, while temporary expenses might seem like an easy fix, the consequences of printing 'temporary' money are too great to ignore.","They do, and it causes inflation because the money doesn't have any material value behind it.

The first structural piece under the rotation head, the lifter module, is more complex than the rest; it includes slides and jacks. The complete assembly process involves anchoring the base and setting up the horizontal arm. Once that's ready, the lifter module jacks up the head and the arm, and the crane lifts a structural segment off a truck and into place. Once the new segment is bolted in, the jacks retract and are bolted onto the new top structural segment. This process is repeated until the crane is as tall as it needs to be.

Which is a constant rushing sound. Rain kinda sounds like that, just like a rolling car, or vacuum cleaner. This makes us feel safe and comfortable. And again sleepy.

In the 19th century, people started to work longer hours and needed more time off. Samuel Augustus Gardiner, a British civil servant, suggested shorter workweeks in the US in 1880. He believed that working six days a week would lead to overwork and burnout. This idea gained traction, and by the early 1900s, most Americans were on Saturdays and Sundays as their 'weekend.' It wasn't until the 1950s that weekends became more widely accepted as a day off for everyone.","Henry Ford has been credited with creating the weekend as we know it today. Apparently the normal work week used to be six days, and Sunday was the day of rest. When Ford was paying workers $2 per day (maybe $2.50, not sure), the going rate at the time, there was lots of turnover and constant hiring and training, so Ford decided to double the rate to $5 per day to reduce turnover and keep employees instead of constantly training new hires. At the same time, he also decided to make a five day work week to give his employees Saturday off, thinking they would buy more cars to ride around in for the weekend. The local business community told him he would bankrupt his business. The day after he ran a full page ad in the paper for the $5 per day jobs, there were massive lines of people applying for jobs with Ford.

318,; Bohr vs Einstein puzzle solution.,"Imagine you're trying to catch a fish using two different methods: one where it's like chasing after waves, and another where it's like catching particles.

Einstein thought of them as being like individual balls that are always in one place - but he didn't think about how those balls could be both waves and particles at the same time!

Container B has 100 units of B and 10 units of A. When you take a scoop from container B, you have about 0.91 units of A, and 9.09 units of B (since that solution is 10/110 liquid A).

346,Why does my stationary leg hurt when I ride a skateboard?,"When you ride a skateboard, your stationary leg hurts because of several reasons. Here's why it happens and how you can fix it:
1. **Muscle fatigue**: Riding a skateboard is hard work for your muscles! When you pedal or push off the ground, your legs are working really hard to keep you moving. This makes them tired and sore.
2. **Lack of balance**: If you're not paying attention while riding, you might lose your balance and fall. This can cause pain in your stationary leg because it's not getting enough blood flow or oxygen.
3. **Poor posture**: When you ride a skateboard, you need to keep your back straight and your head up. If you slouch or lean forward, you put pressure on your stationary leg, making it hurt.
4. **Weak core muscles**: Your core muscles (like your abs) help keep your body stable. If they're not strong enough, they can't support your legs properly, leading to discomfort in the stationary leg.
5. **Overuse/repetitive strain**: Riding a skateboard is repetitive and demanding on your muscles. If you do it too much or for too long, your stationary leg can get tired and hurt.
6. **Lack of rest**: When you ride a skateboard regularly, your stationary leg doesn't get enough time to rest and recover. This means it's not getting the TLC it needs to heal and feel better.","More to the point, it is almost like doing a one legged squat. In addition to holding all your weight up, you are lowering yourself several inches (with one leg) each time you kick/push with the other leg.

369,"Why does food (meat, cheese, bread, vegetables) taste different when sliced thin vs thick?","When you slice meat, cheese, bread, or vegetables thin, it's like opening a door to different flavors inside. Here's what happens:

Imagine each piece of food as a tiny little package with special ingredients inside.

Slicing thin releases these ingredients into your mouth more easily, kind of like when you open a bottle of wine - the flavors get out faster and mingle together.

On the other hand, slicing thick makes it harder for those same flavors to escape, like trying to squeeze water through a narrow straw. The flavors have to work harder to get out, so they don't mix as well with each other.

This difference in how flavors interact is what gives you that distinct taste when food is sliced thin vs thick.

So, the next time you're enjoying your favorite snack or meal, remember: it's not just about chewing - it's about releasing those delicious flavors to experience them fully!","I would guess it's because there's a greater surface area to volume ratio, so comparatively more of the food gets exposed to the air.

377,"I've heard that no matter where you are in the universe, you're still equidistant from the universe's ""edges"" as it expands. How is this so? Or am I getting this wrong?","{""The concept you're referring to is called the 'cosmological horizon'

In simple terms, the cosmological horizon is the distance light could have traveled since the Big Bang.

Imagine a big balloon with dots on it. The dots represent galaxies and other objects in the universe. As you move away from these dots, the dots get farther apart because light takes time to reach them.

The cosmological horizon marks the point where this distance is equal to or greater than the speed of light. Beyond this point, no light can escape the expansion of the universe.

In other words, if you were to travel faster than light, you'd never be able to get any closer to the edges of the universe because time itself would slow down for you relative to someone who stayed behind. This is why we're all equidistant from the edges of the universe - it's just a matter of how fast we're moving towards them.

This idea was first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1927 and later confirmed by observations of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s. It's now widely accepted as one of the key features of our universe.","The ""edges"" of the universe are just as far as we can see, not physical edges, because the light at the edges is from the beginning of the universe and there can't be any light from before the universe.

385,How much of the music does a songwriter actually write?,"{""Structural elements contribute significantly to the overall structure of a song.
It's like building with blocks, where you start with a basic shape and then add more blocks to make it taller or wider.
The same is true for music. You might have an idea for a song, but over time, you refine your initial ideas to create a cohesive listening experience.
You might change the melody, add new lyrics, or even experiment with different chord progressions. All these changes help shape the song into what it becomes.
So, while some of the music is written down in notes and lyrics, much of it is created through the process of building and refining your ideas over time. This is why songs can be more than just a collection of notes – they're a story that unfolds with each new layer added.
In short, the structure of a song is like a puzzle, where you start with some pieces (your initial ideas) and then add more to make it complete. And as you continue to build and refine your music, those pieces become even more meaningful and connected together.
This process can take time, but it's what makes songs so unique and memorable. So, don't be surprised if a song seems to evolve over time – that's just the natural process of creating something beautiful and meaningful through music.","It is sort of complicated.

This same observer might describe that persons ethnicity as being Jamaican, Vietnamese, or Polish.  There are all sorts of problems with these kinds of artificial designations, the most important of which is that there really is no such thing as [""race](_URL_0_)"" *per sé*.",24.675014972686768,success,2026-01-21T15:23:47.938691,,0.27979274611398963,0.031413612565445025,0.14507772020725387,0.7839133739471436,0.7839133739471436,0.7839133739471436,0.0,15.572324752807617,8,7,7.0,"The generated answer provides a clear and accurate distinction between race and ethnicity, using relatable analogies to explain the differences.

""","60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. Lots of options for splitting time into neat segments. You can divide 60 into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, sixths, tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths. 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5. So you can only divide it neatly into halves and fifths. It's just not as flexible. Edit: I'm a political junkie, so I comment on a lot of threads featuring hot-button issues.
