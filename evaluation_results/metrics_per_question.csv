3,How do we know all the money the government is getting from bank settlements is going back to the people?,"Increased transparency and robust oversight are key to ensuring that government-settlement funds benefit the people.

Transparency helps to build trust in the allocation process, allowing citizens to hold their elected officials accountable for how their tax dollars are being used. This can include making detailed reports on where settlement money is being allocated, as well as providing regular updates on the effectiveness of these allocations.

Robust oversight is also crucial to preventing misallocations and ensuring that settlement funds are being used in a responsible manner. This can involve establishing independent review boards or other mechanisms to monitor the allocation process and identify potential issues before they become major problems.

By combining increased transparency with robust oversight, it's possible to ensure that government-settlement funds are being used effectively and efficiently, and that they benefit the people who need them most.",I'm pretty confident most of it isn't going back to the people.

4,What are good and bad sides of manual and automatic drive gear?,"The good sides of manual and automatic drive gear are as follows:
1. **Fuel Efficiency**: Manual transmissions can be more fuel efficient in some cases, especially for drivers who frequently drive in hilly or mountainous terrain. This is because manual transmissions allow the driver to manually shift gears, which can help reduce engine RPM and improve fuel efficiency.
2. **Cost of Maintenance**: Manual transmission cars are typically cheaper to maintain than automatics due to fewer moving parts. This means less wear and tear on the vehicle, resulting in lower maintenance costs over time.
3. **Driving Experience**: Driving a manual transmission car can be more engaging and enjoyable for drivers who enjoy the process of shifting gears manually. It requires coordination between the driver and the vehicle, which can enhance overall driving experience.
4. **Performance**: Manual transmissions can provide better performance in certain situations, such as when accelerating from a standstill or climbing steep hills. This is because manual transmissions allow the driver to control gear shifts more precisely, resulting in improved acceleration and responsiveness.
5. **Customization**: Manual transmission cars often have more customization options available, allowing drivers to tailor their vehicle to their specific needs and preferences. This can include upgrading or modifying the transmission, engine, or other components to suit individual driving habits or preferences.
6. **Towing Capacity**: Manual transmissions are generally better suited for towing heavy loads, as they provide more control over gear shifts and torque delivery. This makes them a popular choice among truck owners who need to tow trailers or boats regularly.
7. **Reliability**: Manual transmission cars tend to be more reliable than automatics, especially in terms of their ability to withstand high mileage without significant issues. This is because manual transmissions require less complex electronics and fewer sensors, which can reduce the risk of failure over time.
8. **Cost of Replacement Parts**: Manual transmission car parts are often cheaper to replace than automatic transmission parts, making them a more cost-effective option for owners who need to repair or replace their vehicle's transmission.
9. **Performance in Certain Driving Situations**: Manual transmissions can provide better performance in certain driving situations, such as when navigating tight corners or climbing steep hills. This is because manual transmissions allow the driver to control gear shifts and torque delivery more precisely, resulting in improved acceleration and responsiveness.
10. **Driving School Experience**: Many driving schools use manual transmission cars for their students to learn how to drive a manual transmission vehicle. This can be an excellent way for new drivers to gain experience and build confidence behind the wheel.","Automatics weigh more, so that alone makes gas mileage worse. They are also more complicated, so that means reliability is going to be lower. It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car.

5,How do muscles grow?,"Muscle growth is a gradual process that requires patience, consistency, and dedication. Proper nutrition, rest, and recovery are essential for muscle growth. Progressive overload is necessary for muscle growth. Genetics play a role in muscle growth. Supplementation may aid muscle growth. Rest and recovery are critical for muscle growth. Consistency is key to achieving muscle growth. Muscle growth requires patience, consistency, and dedication.","I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to ""feed"" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another day.",31.03972554,success,2025-11-13T14:44:16.903418,,11.061656951904297,0.22127659574468087,0.017167381974248927,0.12765957446808512
6,Why does the water from my kitchen faucet taste different than the water from my bathroom faucet? Doesn't it come from the same place?,"Yes, the water from your kitchen faucet and bathroom faucet do come from the same source - the municipal water supply. However, the treatment processes, distribution systems, pipe materials, and local water quality issues can all contribute to differences in taste between the two faucets.","Yes, but the pipes going to one place could have a build up that's changing the taste or the composition of the pipes can be different, i.e. pvc pipes going to your kitchen, but copper pipes to your bathroom.",29.67296863,success,2025-11-13T14:44:46.579883,,22.604646682739258,0.3058823529411765,0.024096385542168672,0.18823529411764706
7,"If dark colours absorb more heat, why does light skin burn easier than dark skin?","There is no direct correlation between dark skin tone and an increased risk of light skin burning in hot environments. In fact, the opposite is often true: lighter skin types tend to burn more easily in high temperatures due to several factors.

Melanin, a pigment responsible for skin color, actually helps protect against excessive heat by absorbing or scattering sunlight. However, when exposed to intense heat, melanin can also act as an insulator, trapping heat close to the skin's surface and reducing convection currents that help dissipate it.

Additionally, lighter skin types tend to have thinner skin, which allows for better heat transfer and increased sweating rates in hot environments. This can lead to a higher risk of burns when exposed to excessive heat.

Finally, blood flow to the skin can also play a role in temperature regulation. In hotter climates, darker skin tones may experience increased blood flow to the skin's surface, which can help dissipate heat more efficiently and reduce the risk of sunburn or heat-related illnesses.","Two things going on here. First, heat doesn't have anything to do with sunburn, it's all about UV rays. Encountering more UV rays = more sunburn. However, dark skin absorbs more UV rays than pale skin. And in fact that's exactly why it burns less. The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns (because it's the lower, reproducing cells that matter, the upper ones are disposable protection). Just like sitting outside under an opaque black umbrella would shade you more than sitting outside under a translucent white one.",13.59831071,success,2025-11-13T14:51:20.542690,,10.778042793273926,0.23826714801444043,0.021818181818181816,0.10830324909747294
8,How the fuck does Facebook know about people I know?!,"Facebook's vast network of third-party apps, devices, and browsers allows it to collect a wide range of user data, including information about the people you know.

9,Why is chickenpox worse as an adult?,"4. Complications
Explanation: As adults, chickenpox can lead to more severe complications due to weakened immune systems and age-related changes. This can result in hospitalization, prolonged recovery time, and increased risk of secondary infections.
","It's mostly due to the difference in immune system between a child and an adult. A primary varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic.  Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called ""shingles"" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection.",21.59608483,success,2025-11-13T14:56:29.998861,,22.67194175720215,0.21714285714285717,0.046242774566473986,0.13714285714285715
10,How do movies not get uploaded online in HD from movie theater employees before their DVD release?,"Theatrical windowing strategy is the key to why movies are not uploaded online in HD from movie theater employees before their DVD release.
It's a complex process that involves negotiating distribution agreements with streaming services, securing copyright and licensing agreements, implementing DRM systems, and managing technical limitations. Here's how it works:
1. **Copyright and Licensing Agreements**: Movie theaters obtain the rights to distribute movies through licensing agreements with studios or distributors. These agreements specify the terms under which they can show the movie in their theater.
2. **DRM Systems**: To prevent piracy, movie theaters use Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems to protect their content. DRM systems encrypt and watermark the digital copies of the movie, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access them online.
3. **Distribution Agreements with Streaming Services**: Movie studios often distribute movies through streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime, which then sell these services to consumers. To comply with copyright laws, these streaming services must obtain licenses from the movie studio or distributor.
4. **Theatrical Windowing Strategy**: The theatrical windowing strategy involves releasing movies in theaters for a limited time (usually 14-18 days) before making them available on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital platforms. This allows studios to recoup their investment in marketing and distribution costs while also generating revenue from home video sales and rentals.
5. **Technical Limitations**: Finally, technical limitations such as bandwidth constraints, encoding quality, and compression algorithms can limit the quality of online HD uploads. To mitigate these issues, movie theaters often use high-quality encoding formats like H.264 or H.265, which offer better compression ratios than older codecs like MPEG-2.
","The theater will be fined a massive amount of money for allowing a leak, the person leaking it will be fined a massive amount of money for uploading it, and they automatically lose their job. This is a combination of copyright law violation and contracts that you sign when taking the job. So the risk are so extremely high that most will not risk it.  They also have security features such as login codes to open, proprietary file types that need special programs to play, and the rooms operating the projector system requiring special key access at times.",25.65136838,success,2025-11-13T14:56:55.654424,,12.911099433898926,0.2192513368983957,0.01075268817204301,0.09625668449197862
11,Can defense attorneys 'throw' a case if they know their clients are guilty?,"No, defense attorneys cannot 'throw' a case if their clients are guilty. While it's true that defense attorneys aim to present a strong defense and minimize doubt about their client's guilt, they must do so within the bounds of the law. If a defense attorney knows their client is guilty and attempts to present an argument or evidence that suggests otherwise, it could be considered obstruction of justice or other unethical behavior.","Yes, they could 'throw' a case. However, that's a serious ethics violation which would almost certainly cause disbarment if found out, and not only that, the conviction could then be appealed based on ineffective assistance of counsel (embodied in the 6th amendment). If it makes it easier to wrap your head around, think of defense lawyers defending the integrity of the judicial system, not just their client. The idea being, the system must obey all of its own rules in proving that someone is guilty, or else it's a dishonest system and could easily ""prove"" that an innocent person is guilty next time.

13,"Why are some fish bones edible, and others are not?","The type of fish, diet, processing methods, and calcium carbonate content all play a role in determining whether some fish bones are edible or not.

Some fish bones, such as cod and haddock, have been found to be edible due to their low calcium carbonate content. This is because these fish tend to have lower levels of calcium carbonate in their bodies, making them less likely to cause digestive issues when consumed.

On the other hand, some fish bones, like those from sharks and rays, are high in calcium carbonate and can cause digestive problems if ingested. These fish often have higher levels of calcium carbonate in their diets, which can lead to constipation or other gastrointestinal issues when eaten.

The type of fish is also a factor. Some species, such as tuna and mackerel, tend to have lower levels of calcium carbonate than others, like salmon and cod. This is because these fish often have higher levels of protein and lower levels of fat, which can contribute to their low calcium carbonate content.

Diet plays a significant role in determining whether fish bones are edible. Fish that eat a diet high in plant material may have lower levels of calcium carbonate than those that eat a diet high in animal material. For example, fish that eat algae or seaweed tend to have lower levels of calcium carbonate than those that eat meat.

Finally, processing methods can also affect whether fish bones are edible. Fish bones that are processed into flour or other products may be less likely to cause digestive issues if consumed, as the processing can help break down some of the harder-to-digest compounds in the bone.","They are small and soft so it does not matter if you swallow them, bigger and harder bones might get stuck in your throat and couse pain",20.62364149,success,2025-11-13T14:58:01.614924,,6.112112522125244,0.06493506493506494,0.0,0.03896103896103896

15,Why can't we just taste candy or Sweets and then spit it out to avoid its unhealthy attributes? What makes us swallow it to get satisfaction?,"The key to understanding why we can't just taste candy or sweets and spit it out is that our brains are wired to respond to sweetness with a release of dopamine, which is associated with pleasure and reward. This makes us more likely to reach for sugary treats when we're feeling stressed, bored, or emotional. Additionally, the lack of satiety cues, the gradual reduction of sugar intake, and the support system all play a role in shaping our eating habits and cravings. By understanding these underlying factors, we can take steps to create healthier relationships with food and develop more balanced habits.","You absolutely could.  But the fact is that evolution shaped our tastes. That's why fatty foods and sweet foods are so appealing to out taste buds. It is our bodies way of saying ""That has lots of calories and will help us avoid starving."" The 'satisfaction' you feel on swallowing it is simply the body saying ""Good job. Remember that tastes good so we will eat it again if we find it again."" Rewarding you for fueling it.

16,Why are the things that taste the best bad for us?,"There is no single answer to this question, but rather a collection of factors that contribute to the negative effects of certain foods on our health.

The best way to approach this topic is to consider the following key points:

1. High sugar intake can lead to negative health effects when consumed in excess.
2. Acidity can cause digestive issues and potentially harm our overall health.
3. Fatty acids can be detrimental if consumed excessively, leading to inflammation and other health problems.
4. Sodium can have negative effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular health when consumed in large amounts.
5. Additives and preservatives can contain unhealthy ingredients that may not be good for us.
6. The glycemic index (GI) of a food can affect how it affects our blood sugar levels and overall health.

It's essential to note that moderation is key, and the impact of these factors depends on various individual circumstances, such as age, sex, and overall diet quality.","Let's think about this from an evolutionary perspective. Way back in the day, (like way way way back) humans struggled for food just like every other animal. It was to our species evolutionary advantage to pursue food that would keep us full longer, or provide more energy than other food options. Fats, are 9 calories per gram compared to proteins and carbs that are 4 calories. Humans that preferred fats and craved them, had a higher chance of survival and passing on the fat craving trait.

19,What classifies an island as an island? Aren't all continents etc essentially large islands?,"3. Not connected to the mainland
Explanation: The definition of an island typically refers to a piece of land that is separated from the mainland by water, and is not connected to it. This means that an island may be a small, isolated piece of land, but it does not necessarily have to be large or extensive in size.
In contrast, continents are much larger than islands and are often surrounded by oceans or seas. Similarly, other types of landmasses, such as peninsulas or archipelagos, can also meet the definition of an island.
The key distinction between an island and a continent is not necessarily their size, but rather their relationship to the mainland and their distinct boundary with water.","While not universally true (especially in the case of Europe who gets to be called its own continent for purely cultural/political reasons) A continent is considered to be the primary landmass on its tectonic plate. If you look at a map of tectonic plates: _URL_0_ You can clearly see that with a few notable exceptions such as Europe and India. In general continents occupy their own tectonic plate.  So then if you are a landmass that is part of a continent's tectonic plate but is not connected by land to that continent, than you would be an island.

20,why does wikipedia ask for donations almost every month? do they really need it to not disappear?,"Wikipedia does not need donations to survive, and it's actually a matter of transparency and accountability. Here's why:

1. **Server costs are significant**: Wikipedia relies on server costs to host its vast database of articles, which is estimated to be around $100 million annually.

2. **Content creation and moderation expenses**: The platform also incurs costs for creating and maintaining high-quality content, as well as moderating user interactions to ensure a safe and respectful community.

3. **Lack of advertising revenue**: Unlike many other websites, Wikipedia does not generate significant revenue from advertisements, which means it relies on donations to sustain itself.

4. **Contributor support**: The platform relies on multiple contributors to maintain its infrastructure, creating high-quality content and supporting its community. While this is a valuable resource, it's not enough to cover the costs of maintaining the site.

5. **Transparency and accountability**: Wikipedia is committed to transparency and accountability, publishing financial reports and providing regular updates on its operations. This level of transparency helps to build trust with users and stakeholders.

In summary, while donations are appreciated, they're not necessary for Wikipedia's survival. The platform has a stable financial situation, relies on multiple contributors, and is transparent about its operations.

24,Why is sales tax in the US excluded from the list price?,"The reason sales tax in the US is excluded from the list price is due to its classification as a consumption tax, rather than a value-added tax (VAT). Consumption taxes are levied on the purchase of goods or services by consumers, whereas VATs are levied on the production or manufacture of goods. As a result, sales tax is typically exempted from being included in the list price, which is the price that retailers pay to suppliers for goods and materials to produce their products.","Because every state has a different tax rate on goods, so that would make putting tax into the price a little difficult",22.35083246,success,2025-11-13T15:02:05.201323,,11.917987823486328,0.16822429906542055,0.019047619047619046,0.13084112149532712
25,Why does a beer on tap almost always taste better than it does from a bottle?,"A combination of factors, rather than any one factor being the sole reason, contributes to a beer on tap tasting better than it does from a bottle.

In this case, let's break down the key points you've listed and explore why they might contribute to the difference in taste between a beer on tap and one from a bottle:

1. **Freshness**: When a beer is poured into a glass at the brewery or winery, it's typically served immediately after packaging. This minimizes exposure to oxygen, which can cause the beer to age and lose its flavor and aroma. In contrast, when a beer is stored in a bottle, it's exposed to oxygen, which can lead to oxidation and degradation of the beer's flavors.

2. **Temperature control**: Beer on tap is usually served at a consistent temperature, typically between 45°F and 55°F (7°C and 13°C), which helps preserve its flavor and aroma. Bottled beers, on the other hand, are often stored in refrigerators or freezers, where they can be chilled to an even lower temperature, but this can also lead to a loss of flavor and aroma.

3. **Carbonation**: When a beer is poured into a glass at the brewery or winery, it's usually carbonated immediately after packaging. This helps preserve the beer's carbonation level and prevents it from becoming flat over time. Bottled beers are often carbonated in a bottle or can, which can lead to a loss of carbonation.

4. **Oxygen exposure**: As mentioned earlier, oxygen is a major contributor to the degradation of beer flavors and aromas. When a beer is stored in a bottle, it's exposed to oxygen, which can cause it to oxidize and lose its flavor and aroma over time.

5. **Handling and storage**: The way a beer is handled and stored can also impact its taste. For example, beers that are stored in a cool, dark place tend to last longer and retain their flavor and aroma better than those that are exposed to light or heat.

6. **Pump priming**: Pump priming involves adding a small amount of beer to the tap before serving it. This helps to maintain the beer's carbonation level and prevents it from becoming flat over time. It also allows the brewery to control the amount of oxygen that enters the tap, which can help preserve the beer's flavor and aroma.

7. **Quality control**: Finally, quality control measures such as regular inspections and testing for contaminants can help ensure that beers are bottled or packaged properly and are free from defects that could impact their taste.

In summary, a combination of factors contributes to a beer on tap tasting better than it does from a bottle. By minimizing exposure to oxygen, controlling temperature and carbonation levels, preventing oxidation, handling and storing the beer properly, using pump priming, and implementing quality control measures, breweries can help preserve the flavor and aroma of their beers.

Ultimately, the specific reasons for the difference in taste between a beer on tap and one from a bottle will depend on the brewery's practices and the type of beer being served.","Probably because the keg has been better handled than the cases of beer have, and because bottles are not actually the best packages for beer. Light passes through the glass and can cause skunking, and oxygen can sneak in through the plastic seal in the crown, causing staling. Kegs are generally stored cold, and of course are completely opaque and are much more resistant to oxygen ingress.",22.5259831,success,2025-11-13T15:02:27.732353,,6.769331932067871,0.12730318257956447,0.013445378151260503,0.09380234505862647

30,why do we like watching the same TV show or movie over and over again?,"4. Habit Formation
We tend to watch the same TV show or movie repeatedly because it's a habitual behavior that can be easily formed and sustained over time. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns, and when we see familiar characters, settings, or storylines, it triggers a sense of comfort and familiarity, making us more likely to continue watching.

This is especially true for shows like 'Friends', 'The Office', or 'Game of Thrones' which have become ingrained in our cultural consciousness. The predictability of the show's narrative, characters, and tone also contributes to its habit-forming nature.

In contrast, movies like 'Star Wars' or 'The Lord of the Rings' are often more complex and open-ended, making them less likely to be repeated due to their unique storytelling and character development.

So, while comfort, predictability, and emotional connection can all play a role in our love for watching the same TV show or movie over and over again, habit formation is often the primary driver behind this behavior.","Our brains like familiar things. Something we already have seen is easier to get into than something brand new because it requires less attention and effort from our brain.

31,why do the French have an abstain vote instead of people physically restraining from voting. [Other],"The French abstention vote is influenced by a feeling of political non-representation, as well as four key points: high areas with low turnout, the performance of far-right parties, and the presence of 'ballot blanc' or white ballots that have been used in protests. This suggests that the French system allows for a form of protest voting, where people can express disaffection without actually participating in the electoral process.

The history of ballot blancs dates back to 1789, when they were first introduced as a way to allow citizens to voice their discontent with the government without having to physically cast a vote. Over time, these ballots have become a popular choice for those who want to express themselves but don't feel represented by the existing political system.

In recent years, the use of ballot blancs has grown in popularity, particularly among young people and those who feel disconnected from mainstream politics. This trend suggests that the French system is allowing for a form of non-participatory voting, where citizens can express their disaffection without having to actively participate in the electoral process.

The fact that over 28% of voters stayed away from the ballot boxes during this year's presidential election is also a notable statistic. This suggests that many people are feeling disillusioned with the current political landscape and are choosing not to participate in the electoral process.

Overall, the French abstention vote represents a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that reflects the country's unique political culture and history.","It's like a protest vote.

33,#NAME?,"The design trade-offs between thermal management, power consumption, and cooling mechanisms have led to the development of different cooling strategies for phones and other small appliances. Here's a breakdown of each key point and how they contribute to the differences in cooling requirements.

1. **Thermal Management**: Thermal management refers to the ability of an electronic device to dissipate heat generated by its operation. Phones, being smaller and more compact, require less thermal management than larger appliances like refrigerators or air conditioners. The reduced size and weight of phones also make it easier to design efficient cooling systems that are not only effective but also compact.

2. **Power Consumption**: Power consumption is another critical factor in determining the need for cooling vents on a phone versus other small appliances. Phones typically consume less power than larger appliances, which means they require less heat energy to operate. As a result, phones can be designed with smaller cooling systems that are not only more efficient but also more compact.

3. **Cooling Mechanisms**: The type of cooling mechanism used can also impact the need for vents on a phone versus other small appliances. Phones often use air-based cooling mechanisms like fans or heat sinks to dissipate heat, which are typically smaller and more discreet than those found in larger appliances. This allows phones to be designed with thinner profiles and reduced visual clutter.

4. **Design Trade-offs**: The design trade-offs between thermal management, power consumption, and cooling mechanisms have led to the development of different cooling strategies for phones and other small appliances. For example, some phones may use passive cooling methods like heat pipes or phase change materials to dissipate heat, while others may employ active cooling systems like liquid cooling or vapor compression refrigeration.

In summary, the design trade-offs between thermal management, power consumption, and cooling mechanisms have resulted in different cooling requirements for phones and other small appliances. By understanding these factors, designers can create more efficient, compact, and effective cooling solutions that meet the unique needs of each device type.","Phones lack a cooling system because there's no room for that. It takes up way too much space for a pocket-size device. If that wasn't an issue, phones would've had vents. Besides, phones don't work as hard as other computers do. They are weaker, so they produce less heat. Still, they can get hot sometimes, especially during charging, and there is nothing we can do about it.

37,Why do we wake up early when we don't have to but tend to wake up late when we need to be up?,"There are several reasons why we tend to wake up early when we don't have to but late when we need to be up. Here's a breakdown of the key points that contribute to this phenomenon:

1. **Internal biological processes**: Our internal biological clock, also known as our circadian rhythm, regulates our sleep-wake cycle. This natural process is controlled by an intricate system involving hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological mechanisms.

2. **External environmental factors**: Light exposure and darkness play a significant role in influencing our behavior. When we're exposed to bright light in the morning, it helps regulate our circadian rhythm, making us feel more alert and awake. Conversely, when we're in a dark environment, our body produces melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleepiness.

3. **Habits and self-care practices**: Our daily habits and self-care routines can significantly impact our ability to wake up on time. For example, if you consistently hit the snooze button or have a morning routine that's not conducive to waking up early, it can be challenging to establish an early wake-up time.

4. **Exercise and sleep quality**: Regular exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality and duration. When we're physically active, our body produces more cortisol (a hormone that helps us feel alert) in the morning, making us feel more awake and energized. Additionally, exercising in the morning can help regulate our circadian rhythm, leading to a more consistent wake-up time.

In conclusion, it's essential to understand the complex interplay between internal biological processes, external environmental factors, habits, and self-care practices that influence our wake-up times. By acknowledging these factors and making conscious changes to our daily routines, we can improve our sleep quality, increase our alertness, and establish a more consistent wake-up time.",The simple answer is stress causes this. By setting a schedule your body will fall into a rhythm. After a while you don't really need the alarm at all. However as we know our natural rythems get disturbed occasionally. When we must get up we are creating stress that is easiest to avoid by doing nothing and that is what we want to do (avoid stress).

38,"Why do tech/software companies stay in the US when they are demanded to include backdoors by the US government? Can't tech companies just develop and release their products overseas, out of reach of the US government's influence?","There are several reasons why tech/software companies stay in the US despite demands from the US government to include backdoors in their products.

1. Complex global supply chains, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, tax and employment laws, investor confidence, lack of clear guidance, industry norms, and logistical complexities make it difficult for them to operate effectively overseas.

2. Developing products overseas would require significant investment, infrastructure development, and operational changes that companies may not be willing or able to undertake.

3. The US has a robust system of intellectual property laws that protect patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, making it harder for companies to maintain control over their products in foreign locations.

4. Compliance with various regulations across different countries can be complex and time-consuming, especially for international companies.

5. Tax laws and regulations differ significantly across countries, leading to double taxation or unfavorable tax treatment for US-based companies.

6. The US government's stance on backdoors is not well-defined, creating uncertainty for tech companies about what constitutes a 'backdoor' and how to address the issue.

7. Companies face significant challenges in operating effectively without a well-defined regulatory framework and clear guidance on what constitutes a 'backdoor'.

8. The US has a large number of tech companies, with over 90 notable companies generating around $70 billion each year, making it an attractive location for investment.

9. Tech professionals in the US have an average salary of around $110,000, highlighting the industry's robustness and competitiveness.

10. The US is home to some of the top tech companies in the world, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple.

11. Including backdoors in software is often a requirement due to government demands, which can be seen as an attempt to exert influence over domestic technology companies rather than address legitimate security concerns.

12. Some tech companies have faced criticism for not providing adequate security measures, but this does not necessarily mean they are unwilling or unable to comply with government requests.

13. The US has a complex regulatory environment that can make it difficult for tech companies to operate freely, leading some to seek alternative locations outside the country.","The short answer is that it's not just the US government pushing to include ""backdoors.""

42,"If a computer has a GPU, why would reducing GUI effects impact performance?","Reducing GUI effects does not necessarily impact performance for several reasons:
1. The GPU's workload is often independent of the GUI; it handles tasks like rendering, physics, and other computationally intensive operations.
2. Many modern applications use techniques to reduce or minimize GUI effects, such as anti-aliasing, texture filtering, and level of detail (LOD) optimization, which can help reduce computational requirements without affecting performance.
3. Even in resource-constrained environments, the GPU's workload is often dominated by tasks like 2D rendering, physics simulations, and data processing, rather than GUI-specific operations. Therefore, reducing GUI effects may not have a significant impact on overall system performance.
4. In low-end systems, small improvements to GUI effects can make a noticeable difference in terms of visual quality and user experience, but these improvements are often limited by the hardware's capabilities and the software's optimization techniques.","If you're talking about Windows Vista and beyond. **Disabling visual effects doesn't increase performance** More detailed explanation is here: _URL_0_ ELI5: This checkbox just switches off new system (GPU rendering) and brings back XP CPU rendering, because some software can't use new system.

45,Why are the insides of Ovens Dark and Not Metallic or Mirror Like?,"The insides of ovens are dark and not metallic or mirror-like due to a combination of factors, including insulation, thermal mass, cooking surface materials, and ventilation strategies.

Insulation is crucial in an oven as it helps retain heat and reduce energy consumption. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the oven are typically made of thick, insulating materials like ceramic, refractory brick, or concrete. These materials absorb and store heat, keeping the oven warm for a longer period.

Thermal mass is another key factor in an oven's temperature regulation. Thermal mass refers to the ability of a material to absorb and release heat slowly. This property helps maintain a stable oven temperature, even after the cooking process is complete. For example, a thick layer of insulation can slow down the transfer of heat from the oven's interior to the exterior.

Cooking surface materials also play a significant role in an oven's appearance. Common cooking surfaces include ceramic tiles, stoneware, or metal racks. These materials absorb and reflect heat, giving ovens their characteristic dark color. Additionally, some cooking surfaces may be coated with a reflective finish to enhance heat retention.

Ventilation strategies are also essential in maintaining the proper temperature inside an oven. Proper ventilation helps remove excess moisture and gases produced during cooking, preventing them from accumulating and reducing the risk of fire hazards. This is especially important for high-heat cooking methods like broiling or grilling.",How often do you polish the inside of your oven?

46,Why does metal react so violently when microwaved?,4. dielectric breakdown,"The way microwaves work is through jiggling charged/polar particles in your food (the water primarily). This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another.  Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike.",20.83178973,success,2025-11-13T15:59:37.187446,,495.4302978515625,0.0,0.0,0.0

66,American TV shows compared to The rest of the world.,"American TV shows are distinct from their international counterparts due to differences in genre, tone, and style.

In comparison to other parts of the world, American TV shows often feature a mix of genres such as drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi. This diversity is largely attributed to the country's cultural influences, historical context, and television production practices.

Tone-wise, American TV shows can range from light-hearted and humorous (e.g., sitcoms) to darker and more serious (e.g., dramas). The style of storytelling also differs significantly between countries, with some nations favoring more traditional or documentary-style approaches, while others opt for a more fast-paced and action-oriented format.

Examples of American TV shows that deviate from global counterparts include 'Breaking Bad,' which is known for its intense drama and dark tone; 'The Office,' which is often classified as a mockumentary-style sitcom; and 'Game of Thrones,' which combines fantasy elements with epic storytelling.

In contrast, many international TV shows tend to focus on more realistic and nuanced portrayals of everyday life, such as 'The Wire' in the United States or 'This Is England' in the UK. These productions often explore complex social issues and character-driven storylines, showcasing a more subtle and layered approach to storytelling.

67,How do people add colour so accurately to black and white photos?,"LUTs (Look-Up Tables) and color grading techniques are used to add color accuracy to black and white photos.

Black and white photography involves using color grading tools to achieve a specific look or mood, which allows photographers to accurately add color to their images. This is achieved by adjusting settings such as aperture, ISO, and shutter speed to control the amount of color added to the image.

LUTs are pre-defined color profiles that can be applied to an image to change its color tone and saturation. They are often used in post-processing software like Lightroom or Photoshop to add a specific look to an image before it is printed or shared online.

Color grading techniques, such as exposure adjustments, contrast curves, and hue vs saturation curves, also play a crucial role in adding color accuracy to black and white photos. By adjusting these settings, photographers can achieve the desired mood or atmosphere for their images.","It's basically painting a transparent picture on top of the black-and-white, and the B/W image provides much of the shading.  In the days before photoshop, you had actual transparent inks with limited tints to choose from, and that's why old hand-colorized photos often look more cartoony. Now, you can pick from a vast range of colors until it more or less matches what you would expect: a white person with fair hair will probably have skin in X color range, unpainted wood furniture is going to be a shade of brown, jeans are almost certainly blue, a military uniform from that era is going to be this particular color, etc.  Plus if you have experience with B/W photography you might have a sense for how some colors will translate to film; they often have a particular range of grey due to the characteristics of a given film.

74,"If animals aren't aware that they are going to die, why would they try so hard to survive?","There are several reasons why animals might try so hard to survive despite not being aware they're going to die. Here are a few possible explanations:

1. **Instincts and learned behaviors**: Animals have evolved instincts, brain structure, social behavior, and physiological responses that influence their behavior and priorities. These innate traits can override rational thinking and lead animals to prioritize survival over self-preservation.

2. **Evolutionary pressures**: In the wild, animals face numerous threats, such as predators, harsh environments, and limited resources. To increase their chances of survival, they may engage in behaviors that put them at risk, even if it means sacrificing their own well-being.

3. **Social bonding and cooperation**: Many animal species are social creatures that rely on each other for survival. They may prioritize the needs of others over their own, even if it means putting themselves at risk.

4. **Fear and anxiety**: Animals can experience fear and anxiety in response to threats or uncertainty. This emotional state can drive them to take risks and engage in behaviors that increase their chances of survival.

5. **Learning and conditioning**: Some animals may learn through observation, imitation, or reinforcement that certain behaviors are beneficial for survival. For example, a young bird may learn to follow a parent's lead to find food, even if it means putting itself at risk.

6. **Brain structure and function**: Research has shown that different brain regions and neural pathways can influence an animal's behavior and decision-making processes. Some animals may have a more ","Does a falling ball ""know"" it's trying to return to Earth? Or does it just do what it must? Animals behave out of instinct. When hungry, they are driven to eat.

75,"How can a computer come up with a ""random"" number?","A computer can generate random numbers through various methods, including thermal noise, pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), and the use of physical phenomena such as radioactive decay or mechanical vibrations. Here's a brief explanation of each method used by computers to produce random numbers:

1. **Thermal Noise**: Thermal noise is a type of random noise that occurs due to the thermal motion of electrons in a conductor, such as a resistor or a wire. This noise is extremely low-frequency and high-amplitude, making it suitable for generating pseudorandom numbers. Computers can amplify this noise using amplifiers and filters to create a signal with a desired statistical distribution.

2. **Random Number Generators (TRNGs)**: TRNGs use physical phenomena such as radioactive decay or mechanical vibrations to generate random numbers. These devices are designed to produce a large number of random events per second, which can be used to generate pseudorandom numbers. TRNGs are often used in high-stakes applications where the slightest deviation from randomness is unacceptable.

3. **Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**: PRNGs use algorithms to simulate random events and produce a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. These algorithms can be based on mathematical formulas, statistical models, or even physical phenomena like thermal noise. PRNGs are widely used in simulations, modeling, and data analysis due to their high degree of randomness and reproducibility.

In summary, computers use various methods to generate random numbers, including thermal noise, TRNGs, and PRNGs. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and requirements.","Generally yes, anything generated by an algorithm can be reproduced if you know the ""initial"" settings. Numbers generated this way are referred to as ""psuedorandom"".  There do, however, exist various dedicated hardware solutions that allow computers to pick truly random numbers. They work by basically installing in the computer some sort of sensor that can detect random properties of nature.  An example might be some sort of detector that picks up low levels of radiation. While we can make statistical predictions of radioactive decay over time, the actual decay of individual particles is truly random, and cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. A sensor designed to measure those tiny random variations and feed them to a computer could generate truly random numbers.",24.1387291,success,2025-11-13T16:30:07.902180,,8.01853084564209,0.29023746701846964,0.05305039787798409,0.1477572559366755

The unique structure of scar tissue, including its high concentration of collagen, elastin, and fibroblasts, makes it difficult to remove.

While it is possible to treat certain types of scars with medical interventions such as laser therapy or steroid injections, the overall composition of scar tissue resists removal.","Scar tissue is different to normal skin. It contains more collagen than regular tissue, and doesn't structure the same as regular skin, which is why it looks so different. It's also less flexible. The benefits to having scar tissue is the body can recover from wounds exceptionally quickly - many animals can't create scar tissue, and so wounds can remain open longer and are more susceptible to infection and other problems. Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen (due to certain illnesses), your scars' wounds can actually reopen. The scar is difficult to get rid of because the tissue has been created in a less structured/ordered form than your regular skin (because it was deployed quickly to help heal the wound), but some medical procedures exist to reduce that effect.",26.94163036,success,2025-11-13T16:30:34.843810,,16.87839698791504,0.23188405797101447,0.048780487804878044,0.14492753623188406

Supply constraints are a key factor in why oil prices don't decrease as quickly as gas prices when oil prices rise. When oil prices increase, there is less supply available to meet the increased demand, leading to higher prices for both oil and gas. However, the refining capacity of refineries can be limited, which means that even if gas prices are lower than before, the price of gasoline may not decrease as quickly because it takes time for refineries to process the new supply of crude oil into gasoline.","On TV, when the price of gas goes up, they say they have no choice but to sell it higher in gas stations too.

90,What would happen if all the countries wiped all the debt incurred by and owed to each other?,"A global economic downturn or stagnation would likely occur as a result of all countries wiping out their debts to each other.

This would lead to a significant decrease in global economic activity, as countries would no longer have the funds to invest, spend, and borrow. This could result in reduced consumption, lower investment, and decreased economic growth.

Debt forgiveness can help countries avoid debt traps and promote fiscal discipline by eliminating the need for borrowing and reducing the risk of future debt accumulation. By clearing their debts, countries would be able to focus on building sustainable economies rather than relying on debt to finance growth.

However, it's worth noting that this approach may not be feasible or desirable in all cases, particularly if a country has significant external liabilities or is heavily indebted to other nations.

Further, a lot of the time what's done is called ""slash and burn"" which means that the forests are chopped down and the debris is cleared away via a controlled fire, once again adding CO2 (and other harmful chemicals) to the atmosphere.

108,why does spicy food stay spicy when it comes out the other end?,"3. Spice fatigue
The reason spicy food stays spicy when it comes out the other end is due to a phenomenon called 'spice fatigue'. This occurs when the body's receptors for capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat, become desensitized over time. As you eat more spicy food, your taste buds and nerve endings in the mouth and throat adapt by becoming less responsive to the capsaicin. This means that even if you've had a particularly spicy meal before, the heat will still be felt when you eat something new. The other options are not directly related to why spicy food stays spicy after it's been cooked out of your system.

Chemical compounds release heat into the mouth and throat: While it is true that capsaicin releases heat when it comes into contact with taste buds, this process occurs quickly and is not what keeps the heat going once it's been released. The body's response to spicy food is more complex than just a simple chemical reaction.

Binding_to_receptors: This term refers to the interaction between molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. In the case of capsaicin, binding to its receptors triggers a response that sends signals to the brain, which interprets this as heat. However, this process is not what keeps the heat going once it's been released.

Spice fatigue: This term refers to the phenomenon where the body becomes less responsive to spicy food over time, making it feel hotter than it actually is. This can occur due to a variety of factors, including repeated exposure to capsaicin and changes in the way the body processes it.","Spiciness isn't a flavor, it's a reaction to the chemical capsaicin, which irritates any tissue it contacts, not just your tongue.

109,Why do posts on reddit not start on 0 (what's the purpose of allowing one to vote for oneself)?,"The purpose behind allowing users to vote for themselves on Reddit is multifaceted and serves several key purposes.

1. **Preventing Spammers**: By giving users the ability to vote for their own posts, Reddit can help reduce spam submissions. This is because spammers often rely on automated tools or bots to submit low-quality content. When a user votes down a post, it's more likely to be reported and removed by moderators.

2. **Encouraging Meaningful Content**: By allowing users to vote for their own posts, Reddit can encourage users to engage with the content they find valuable. This can lead to a more diverse range of topics being discussed and debated on the platform.

3. **Maintaining Community Standards**: Voting for oneself allows users to self-regulate and maintain community standards. If a user feels that a post is not meeting their personal standards, they can choose to vote it down instead of reporting it or leaving a comment. This helps to create a more inclusive and respectful community.

4. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Reddit also uses voting as a feedback mechanism for users. Users can rate the quality of content they've seen, which helps moderators identify areas where the community needs improvement.

5. **Reducing Algorithmic Bias**: By allowing users to vote for themselves, Reddit reduces the reliance on algorithms that prioritize certain types of content over others. This helps to ensure that all user-generated content is treated fairly and without bias.",To reward you for making a comment even if no one else does.,23.09396315,success,2025-11-13T16:55:31.860204,,8.97939682006836,0.0392156862745098,0.007905138339920948,0.03137254901960784
110,How does copyright work with references?,"No more than fair use, no identical or substantially similar work, and no profit from the reference.

Explanation: Copyright law allows for limited use of copyrighted material under the fair use doctrine. Fair use provisions permit limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. However, there are strict guidelines to follow when applying the fair use doctrine. These guidelines include that no more than fair use is allowed, meaning that the amount of copyrighted material used cannot exceed a certain threshold. Additionally, any use must be for a purpose such as criticism or commentary, not for commercial gain, and it must not be identical or substantially similar to the original work.

The key takeaway here is that copyright law has specific guidelines in place to balance the rights of creators with the need for access to copyrighted material. By following these guidelines, individuals can use copyrighted references without infringing on the copyright holder's rights.","US copyright has a Fair Use clause, which a minor reference like the ones you are mentioning fall under.

113,Why do I not smell perfume I've sprayed on me but other people do?,"Individual scent perception and time since application are the main reasons why you may not smell perfume on yourself, but others might notice it.

Scent perception is a highly subjective experience, and what one person can detect as a strong scent, another might not even notice. This is because our brains process smells differently, and we can be influenced by various factors such as concentration, attention, and past experiences.

Time since application also plays a significant role in how long it takes for a scent to become noticeable. Perfume molecules are volatile, which means they evaporate quickly, releasing their fragrance into the air. If you apply perfume too close to your skin or don't let it sit for a while, the scent might not have time to reach its full intensity.

In contrast, when others notice the scent, it's often because they're more aware of their own body odor and the surrounding environment. This can be due to various factors such as social norms, cultural background, or individual differences in perception.

Ultimately, the reason why you might not smell perfume on yourself but others do is likely a combination of these factors. It's essential to remember that scent perception is highly personal and can vary greatly from person to person.","Why don't you see your nose? It's within your vision.

116,Why can I not remember what happens when I'm drunk?,"There are several reasons why you may not remember what happens when you're drunk. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Alcohol's impact on the brain**: Alcohol can alter the way your brain processes information, leading to impaired memory and cognitive function.

2. **Vitamin B1 deficiency**: A lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine) can cause memory loss and other neurological problems when combined with alcohol consumption.

3. **Poor sleep and fatigue**: Dehydration, stress, and poor sleep quality can all contribute to impaired memory and cognitive function after drinking.

4. **Neurotoxicity**: Alcohol can damage brain cells and disrupt normal brain function, leading to memory loss and other cognitive problems.

5. **Blackouts and brain changes**: The combination of alcohol and certain medications or substances can cause blackouts, which are periods of time when you're unable to remember events that occurred during that time.

6. **Brain changes**: Repeatedly drinking can lead to changes in the structure and function of your brain, particularly in areas responsible for memory and cognitive processing.","Memories enter the brain first as short term memory, that is then transformed into a long-term memory.  This is evident because the majority of short-term memories that we experience are lost before they ever make it into what we will call ""long-term"" storage.  When alcohol is consumed it affects your ability to take short-term memories and transform them into long-term memories.  This is why you only may remember small bits and pieces of the night, these are the select short-term memories that were allowed to settle into long-term ones without the interruption of alcohol.

However, there are efforts underway to address these issues through initiatives such as desalination, water recycling, sustainable agriculture, and climate-resilient infrastructure. These measures aim to reduce freshwater waste and promote more efficient use of this precious resource.","When the water ends up in the oceans, it slows down the cycling a lot. Water in aquifers (the stores under the ground that we access when we use wells) and water on Earth's surface are the cheapest to use. We have been either polluting these (surface) or using them too fast for new water to filter in. We have also allowed a lot of water to go to the ocean(storm water runoff from developed areas) , rather than slowly go into the aquifers through the ground. So the result is we are using aquifer water faster than they are getting refilled. When that water is depleted, all water will become more expensive.

120,"Why metal at room temperature feels cold while, say, fabric at room temperature doesn't","They have a higher specific heat capacity than fabrics, which means they can absorb more heat energy before their temperature increases significantly.

Additionally, metals tend to lose heat quickly due to their high thermal conductivity, making them feel cold even when they're at room temperature. In contrast, fabrics are typically less conductive and take longer to warm up or cool down, resulting in a feeling of warmth.

This difference in thermal properties is why metal objects often seem colder than similar materials like fabric, even though both may be at the same temperature.","I believe it has something to do with the rate at which heat from your body is transferred to the material.

122,Why do southern states freak out over a little snow?,"Some people might find it amusing or entertaining to watch a southern state freak out over a little snow because of their cultural background and upbringing. They may have grown up in areas where snow is rare, so the idea of experiencing it can be exciting and new. Additionally, they may have been exposed to media portrayals that exaggerate the severity of snowstorms, making them more likely to freak out. However, this reaction is not universal among southern states, and many people in these regions are not as affected by snow. Furthermore, historical context plays a role, with some areas having experienced severe weather events in the past, which can shape their response to snow. Lastly, psychological factors such as regional pride and identity may also contribute to the unique reaction of southern states to snow. Overall, the combination of cultural influences, lack of experience, media portrayal, historical context, psychological factors, regional pride, and identity all contribute to the region's unique response to snow.","There is essentially no infrastructure to deal with snowfall in southern states because it happens so rarely.

125,Why are swearing words related to genitals and/or sexuality?,"Historical context has played a significant role in associating certain words with genitals or sexuality. In many cultures, profanity was initially used as a way to describe bodily functions or intimate activities, often due to the lack of proper language and social norms around these topics. For example, in ancient Greece and Rome, certain words were used to describe sexual acts or bodily functions without fully understanding their implications. This led to the development of euphemisms and eventually, more explicit language.","Swear words come from things we consider taboo or distasteful. In English-speaking society, we have a lot of taboos surrounding sex, even in this day and age. We also put a very high level of importance on hygiene, so words relating to waste and where they come from are also taboo.  Certain words automatically make your brain think of a subject in a more intense way than others. A colloquial term vs a scientific one. This is true for pretty much anything, even if it isn't a swearword -- sweat vs perspiration, for example. When it's a topic that's taboo, that word becomes a swear.

129,why you can't put metal in the microwave but nothing happens to the metal that it's built from,"You can't put metal in the microwave because of its unique properties, which make it incompatible with microwave energy. Here's why:

1. **Magnetic fields are not affected by metal**: This might seem counterintuitive, but metals are made up of atoms that have electrons orbiting their nuclei. When a magnetic field is applied to these atoms, they can become magnetized and interact with the magnetic field. However, this interaction is weak and doesn't cause any harm.

2. **Electromagnetic induction is weak and non-damaging**: Electromagnetic induction occurs when an electric current is generated in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field. This process is typically used in transformers, generators, and other electrical devices. In the case of microwaves, electromagnetic induction is indeed strong enough to cause heating effects, but the damage is limited to the metal's surface.

3. **Thermal conductivity means metals can get extremely hot**: Metals have high thermal conductivity, which means they can efficiently transfer heat energy. When exposed to microwave radiation, the metal's atoms vibrate rapidly, generating heat through friction and other mechanisms. This heat is then dissipated into the surrounding environment, making it difficult for the metal itself to be heated beyond its melting point.","You can put metal in microwaves, which is a lot come with racks, you just can't put metal with sharp edges/points such as forks and aluminum foil.

131,Why do school hours not match working hours?,"Due to historical context, state and local regulations, and the need for flexibility in education, school hours often do not align with traditional working hours.

Historically, schools were established during daylight hours when children could attend classes during the day. As society's workday lengthened, schools adjusted their schedules accordingly. However, this led to conflicts between students' educational needs and parents' work requirements.

State and local regulations have also played a role in shaping school hours. For example, some states require schools to operate on specific days or hours, while others may allow for more flexibility. Additionally, regulations governing student attendance, curricula, and extracurricular activities can influence the scheduling of classes.

The mismatch between school hours and working hours is often a result of these complex interplay of historical context, state and local regulations, and societal factors.

139,How do spammers spoof a cell phone number to make scam calls?,"Spoofing a cell phone number is a common tactic used by spammers to make scam calls. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Number porting**: Spammers may obtain an existing phone number and transfer it to their own service, making it appear as if the original owner is receiving calls.

2. **Virtual numbers**: They might create a virtual number that looks like it belongs to a legitimate business or individual but is actually owned by them.

3. **Proxy servers**: Spammers can use proxy servers to mask their IP address and make it appear as though the call is coming from a different location.

4. **Spoofing software**: Specialized software can be used to automatically dial phone numbers and spoof caller ID, making it difficult for recipients to identify the number of origin.

5. **Number generation tools**: Spammers may use automated tools to generate new phone numbers or modify existing ones to avoid detection by phone service providers.

6. **Social engineering**: They might trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as their phone number, which can then be used for spoofing.

7. **Auto-dialing software**: This is a common method used by spammers to automatically dial numbers and send scam calls without human intervention.

By using these techniques, spammers are able to make it appear as though they are calling from a legitimate source when in fact they are making scam calls.","When you make an outbound call, the calling system gives the phone system the caller ID information. The reason this can be (legitimately) different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number (this way you’re not giving out the direct number unless you needed to).  The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID.  The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things.",21.52316642,success,2025-11-13T17:40:18.913647,,10.32697582244873,0.32707774798927614,0.03773584905660377,0.1394101876675603

144,Why does a company like Boeing need to make a commercial? It's not like anyone watching is going to buy one.,"To maximize their brand's image, build trust and credibility with the target audience, create an emotional connection, and leverage crisis management to mitigate negative publicity.

 Boeing's commercial is likely a strategic marketing effort aimed at rebranding and repositioning itself in the eyes of consumers. By creating a compelling narrative that showcases its products and services in a positive light, Boeing aims to build recognition and trust with its target audience. This can help to establish a stronger brand reputation and values, ultimately driving business growth.

 Furthermore, by leveraging media exposure and impact, Boeing seeks to maximize the commercial's reach and influence. Additionally, employee engagement and morale are likely important considerations, as a successful commercial can boost the spirits of Boeing's workforce and contribute to a positive company culture.

 Lastly, crisis management through positive messaging is also crucial in this context. By presenting a favorable image and addressing any potential negative publicity, Boeing can mitigate damage to its reputation and maintain public trust.","Companies that have to choose between Airbus or Boeing still consist of people (who can be manipulated through commercials), and they can sadly often do so with bias even though they're supposed to run the numbers and make an informed decision.",29.68196225,success,2025-11-13T17:42:41.123678,,30.816375732421875,0.14423076923076925,0.0,0.08653846153846155
145,How do American football have bruised lungs without also having broken ribs? Isn't that the point of ribs?,"Yes, that's correct. American football players can experience bruised lungs without broken ribs due to the unique anatomy of the rib cage and lung anatomy. The rib cage is designed to protect the heart and lungs, but it also has a unique structure that allows for some degree of flexibility and movement during physical contact in sports like football. This flexibility can sometimes cause injuries to the lungs, even if there are no broken ribs. In fact, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), concussions and other types of head trauma are more common than broken ribs in football players.","This is actually one of the major issues with American football. The padding protects from the blunt hit and spreads out the impact so you aren't taking a lot of force to a particular place on your body, but your body is still being shoved really hard as a whole.

There is no way of guessing which card will come up next, but if you shuffled that deck drew a card (made note of which card it was, replaced it and repeat) millions of times, you would get the Royal Flush 1/48 of the time.

159,Why group mentality is so powerful,"Group mentality is a powerful phenomenon because it leverages multiple psychological mechanisms that work together to influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Here are some key factors that contribute to its power:

1. **Social Identity Theory**: This theory explains how group membership can create a sense of belonging and identity, which motivates individuals to conform to the group's norms and values.

2. **Conformity**: When we're part of a group, we tend to follow the actions and attitudes of others, even if they go against our own interests or values.

3. **Social Proof**: We often look to others in a group as a source of information and guidance, which can influence our decisions and behaviors.

4. **Emotional Contagion**: When we're around others who are excited, anxious, or passionate about something, we tend to feel the same emotions, even if we don't fully understand why.

5. **Group Polarization**: As individuals in a group become more extreme in their views or opinions, they tend to move further away from opposing viewpoints and towards the center of the group.

6. **Cognitive Biases**: Our brains are wired to recognize patterns and make decisions based on incomplete information, which can lead us to overlook flaws in our own thinking or those of others.

7. **Power Dynamics**: The influence of power and authority within a group can shape our attitudes and behaviors, with dominant individuals often exerting control over the group's decision-making process.

8. **Evolutionary Advantages**: From an evolutionary perspective, group mentality provides a survival advantage by allowing us to work together towards common goals, share resources, and increase our chances of success.

In conclusion, group mentality is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple psychological mechanisms. Understanding these factors can help us better navigate social situations, make informed decisions, and appreciate the power of collective influence.","Human nature to belong and conform to social groups, empathy, and natural fear of exclusion.

REMSPs (Risk Evaluation Management Strategies) are regulatory approaches used to ensure that drugs meet rigorous safety standards and benefit patients, while minimizing risks to them. By requiring healthcare providers to follow strict guidelines and protocols for prescribing and dispensing certain medications, REMSPs help to ensure that these drugs are only available through approved channels.

The implementation of REMS programs is a key strategy in reducing the misuse and diversion of prescription drugs, as well as improving patient safety. By making it more difficult for unlicensed individuals to access these medications, healthcare providers can better protect patients from potential harm.

In contrast, requiring a prescription does not necessarily mean that a drug goes from needing one to being able to buy it without a prescription. Rather, it is the implementation of REMS programs that helps to ensure that drugs are used safely and effectively, while also promoting responsible prescribing practices among healthcare providers.","Like you're five?

170,How do cars calculate speed and preview it on the speedometer?,"The correct answer is 4. Speed calculation algorithm.
Explanation: The speed calculation algorithm is used by the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system in cars to calculate their speed based on various sensors and data. This algorithm processes data from sensors such as GPS, accelerometers, and wheel speed sensors to determine the car's speed and adjust the engine power accordingly. The ESC system uses this information to maintain stability and control during acceleration, braking, or cornering.

The ESM (Electronic Stability System) unit is a critical component of the ESC system that processes data from various sensors, including GPS, accelerometers, wheel speed sensors, and others. It uses this data to calculate the car's speed and adjust the engine power to maintain stability and control.

In addition to the speed calculation algorithm, gear ratio calculation is also an important factor in calculating speed. The gear ratio of a vehicle determines how quickly it can accelerate from a standstill or decelerate. By taking into account the gear ratio, the car's speed can be accurately calculated using various mathematical formulas and algorithms.

Therefore, the correct answer is 4. Speed calculation algorithm.","**NOT ELI5** The car's driveshaft also powers a *speedometer cable*, which spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the *speed cup*. This magnet rotates continually in an equal direction. This spinning creates a fluctuating magnetic field. The laws of electromagnetism dictate that a current must therefore flow inside this cup. This current causes the speed cup to also rotate. It attempts to catch up with the speed of the magnet. a *hairspring* stops this, so it only rotates a little. This small motion moves the dial on the speedometer a little. The stronger the current, the faster the cup rotates, the further the speedometer's dial moves.  & nbsp; **ELI5** The driveshaft powers a speedometer cable, which leads to a magnet rotating inside a cup. A current is generated, and the cup tries to rotate also. A spring limits this, moving the dial.

173,"Why is it, that even though I genuinely love Whiskey, I shudder nearly every time I drink some?","It's likely due to a combination of personal associations, cultural stigma, fear of intoxication, physical sensations, and individual sensitivities that contribute to your aversion to whiskey even when you genuinely love it.

Personal associations: Perhaps the smell or taste of whiskey triggers unpleasant memories or emotions associated with past experiences. For instance, if someone has had a negative experience with whiskey in the past, it can create an emotional connection that makes them uncomfortable around it.

Cultural stigma: Whiskey is often viewed as a 'man's drink' in some cultures, which can lead to social anxiety or feelings of not belonging when consuming it. This cultural stigma can also influence individual perceptions and attitudes towards whiskey.

Fear of intoxication: The fear of getting drunk is a common reason people avoid drinking whiskey. Even if you're not concerned about alcohol content, the risk of intoxication can still be unsettling, especially if you're sensitive to its effects.

Physical sensations: Whiskey can cause physical reactions like dry mouth, sweating, or flushing, which might make you feel uncomfortable or anxious when consuming it. These physical responses can be intense and unpleasant for some people.

Individual sensitivities: Everyone's sensitivity to whiskey is different due to various factors such as genetic predispositions, past experiences, or individual differences in brain chemistry. What triggers your aversion to whiskey may not be the same for someone else.","Your conscious brain loves it, but your subconscious brain realizes that alcohol is inherently bad for the body, and causes you to shudder.

177,why child support is based on income rather than what a child would need monthly.,"There are several reasons why child support is typically based on income rather than the amount of money a child would need to meet their basic needs monthly. Here are some key points that explain this approach:

1. **Economic Self-Sufficiency**: The primary goal of child support is to help families become economically self-sufficient. By tying child support payments to income, courts can ensure that the payment amount reflects the family's ability to provide for their child's basic needs.

2. **Cost of Living Variations**: Child support calculations often take into account local cost of living variations. If one parent earns significantly more than the other, the higher-earning parent may not be able to afford the same level of expenses for a child, even if they have more income. By linking payments to income, courts can account for these differences.

3. **Complexity and Variability**: Child support calculations involve numerous factors, including the number of children, ages, health needs, education requirements, and extracurricular activities. Income-based calculations help to simplify this process by focusing on a single metric (income) rather than multiple variables.

4. **Historical Context**: The child support system was established in the 1970s, when the cost of living was lower and the concept of economic self-sufficiency was more straightforward. While attitudes and circumstances have changed since then, the basic principle of linking payments to income remains unchanged.

5. **State and Federal Regulations**: Child support laws and regulations are set by both state and federal governments. These regulations often prioritize economic self-sufficiency over other factors, such as what a child would need monthly. This ensures consistency across jurisdictions and helps to promote fairness in the child support system.","Child support is partially based on income. It is also partially based on the number of children and their age, the cost of basic living expenses and school in that general area, and whether or not any special needs are present. Which sometimes leads to a very high ratio, but that is also something that can happen when both parents live with their children; not all jobs pay a wage that covers a child's reasonable expenses.

186,"Why when we are sick/have an infection does our body temperature go up, as in a fever?","Fever is a natural response to infection, and it's not just about the temperature. When we're sick or have an infection, our body's primary goal is to fight off the invader. One way it does this is by increasing its metabolic rate, which generates heat. This process is called pyrogenesis, and it's triggered by substances called pyrogens, such as cytokines and interferons. These molecules are produced in response to infection and inflammation, and they play a crucial role in activating immune cells and coordinating the body's response to the threat. When we're infected, our hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated, which regulates the body's stress response. The HPA axis releases hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, which help to increase blood flow, heart rate, and metabolic rate. This increased heat production is what we experience as a fever. So, while it may seem counterintuitive, our body's temperature actually goes up during an infection – it's just a natural response to the stress of fighting off the infection.","Many infections grow best at particularly precise temperatures. Your body raises your temperature as a defense mechanism, slowing down the reproduction of the infectious agent and giving your own defenses a chance to 'catch up'.

because state and local funding models that favor state or local dollars often lead to projects being funded through public-private partnerships, which can be more expensive than traditional public funding methods.","Large road projects usually exist to keep the existing road network running, or to improve its relation to the rest of the city. Bridges need to be retrofitted, underpasses capped, tarmac replaced. They may be big projects, but they're really necessary to keep the system functioning like it is. A major public transportation network is an entirely new investment. If you don't do it, you don't it--there's no downside other than that you don't have the network. A comparable project would be the construction of an entirely new highway link (or in some cities, the removal of major highways), which is rare and nowadays often put to voters as well. Of note is that many major highway projects were initiated in a time when referendums for transportation were not as common.",26.45770788,success,2025-11-13T18:33:46.286698,,45.14173889160156,0.14942528735632185,0.0,0.08045977011494253

197,How does the ISS avoid damage from solar wind's if it is always in constant orbit?,"The International Space Station (ISS) uses a combination of measures to protect itself from the harsh effects of solar wind, including shielding materials, radiation-hardened electronics, and active protection systems. These measures are designed to mitigate the impact of solar wind on the station's systems and components, even when it is in constant orbit around Earth.

Solar panels are not mentioned as a factor in protecting the ISS from solar wind damage because they do not generate enough power to pose a significant threat to the station's electronics or other critical systems. In fact, the ISS relies on its onboard power generation and storage systems to operate, which are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space.

The use of shielding materials and radiation-hardened electronics is crucial in protecting the ISS from solar wind damage. Shielding materials can absorb or deflect charged particles from the solar wind, while radiation-hardened electronics are designed to withstand the high levels of radiation that can be generated by solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

Active protection systems, such as magnetic field generators and plasma shields, can also be used to protect the ISS from solar wind damage. These systems work by generating a magnetic field or creating a plasma shield to deflect charged particles away from the station.

Overall, the combination of these measures provides the ISS with an effective defense against solar wind damage, allowing it to operate safely and efficiently in its orbit around Earth.",The ISS orbits beneath the protective shield created by the earth's magnetism.

200,How is Canadian healthcare different from Obamacare?,"Canadian healthcare and Obamacare share some similarities in terms of universal coverage and access to healthcare services, but they have distinct differences due to their unique funding models, provider networks, prescription medication coverage, and out-of-pocket costs. Here's a breakdown of the key points that highlight these differences:
1. **Comprehensive vs. Limited**: Canadian healthcare is more comprehensive and accessible than Obamacare, with a publicly-funded model that provides universal coverage.
2. **Funding Models**: The funding models differ significantly between the two systems. Canadian healthcare is primarily funded through taxes and redistribution of wealth, whereas Obamacare relies on individual premiums, subsidies, and employer-sponsored insurance.
3. **Provider Networks**: The provider networks also vary between the two systems. In Canada, primary care physicians are generally free to choose their own patients, while in the US, Medicare beneficiaries often have limited options due to the complex network of healthcare providers.
4. **Prescription Medication Coverage**: Prescription medication coverage is also different between the two systems. Canadian healthcare provides comprehensive coverage for prescription medications, including brand-name and generic options, whereas Obamacare has faced challenges with providing adequate coverage for certain medications.
5. **Out-of-Pocket Costs**: Out-of-pocket costs vary significantly between the two systems. In Canada, individuals typically pay a small copayment or coinsurance for most services, while in the US, out-of-pocket costs can be substantial due to high deductibles and copayments.
","Canadian healthcare is, more or less, single-payer. Basically, you pay a tax to the government and the government insures you. American healthcare is a big old mess. We have single-payer for some people (Medicare), full-on nationalized healthcare for some (the Veterans' administration, where doctors are government employees), private insurance for many, and no insurance (fuck you and die) for some.  Obamacare is actually working--it's fixing some of the worst problems with private insurance and reducing the number of people with no insurance. But our health care system is still a big old mess.

When a baby is made, half the genes are from the mother and other half is from the father. These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases.  Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically (or is milder). If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformations.",34.90864563,success,2025-11-13T19:51:32.891133,,15.184572219848633,0.16831683168316833,0.020000000000000004,0.07920792079207922

216,Can someone explain what quantum suicide and quantum immortality are?,"I'd be happy to explain what quantum suicide and quantum immortality are.

Quantum suicide, also known as quantum erasure, is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where particles, such as electrons or photons, lose their energy and momentum when they interact with the environment. This process is often referred to as 'quantum decoherence.' When a particle becomes entangled with its surroundings, it loses its quantum state, and any information about its initial properties is lost.

In essence, quantum suicide refers to the idea that particles can sacrifice their energy to become more stable by losing their momentum. This process is often seen in systems where the environment plays a significant role, such as in superconductors or superfluids.

Quantum immortality, on the other hand, proposes that consciousness or information can persist beyond physical death through quantum mechanics. This idea is based on the concept of quantum entanglement and the idea that information cannot be destroyed, only scrambled. Some theories, such as Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) and the Many-Worlds Interpretation, suggest that consciousness may be fundamental to the universe and can survive even in the presence of death.

While these ideas are still highly speculative and require further research, they have sparked interesting discussions about the nature of reality and the possibility of an afterlife. However, it's essential to note that these concepts are not widely accepted by the scientific community yet and require more investigation to be confirmed.","Some people think that when something happens, new versions of reality are made, one for each possible outcome of the thing happening. For example, you flip a coin. In one universe, the coin comes up heads. In another universe it comes up tails. Now say you decide to kill yourself. You get a gun and point it at your head and pull the trigger. In one universe, it goes off and you die. In another, the gun jams and you live. Since the only universe you are alive in is the one where you live, you experience that universe. Therefore, according to you, you do not die. This happens every time you have a chance of dying.

You're probably aware of the Oscars and the Emmy, but there are like a hundred others with their own style and categories.  However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit (and add some flair and promo to the show) by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas (such as animated, comedy's, and sci-fi films), but this is still pretty new. They changed the voting on it a bit too, but its unknown if this had any effect on the eventual winners.

The fat content falls between whole milk and cream, which makes it less susceptible to spoilage. Additionally, the higher cream content helps extend its shelf life. Carrageenan, a thickenening agent, also contributes to its longer shelf life. Ultra-high-temperature processing, while effective in pasteurizing milk, does not significantly impact half-and-half's shelf life due to its lower temperature requirements. As long as it is properly refrigerated after opening, half-and-half can remain fresh for several weeks.

226,Why are smoke shops allowed to sell bongs?,"B
Explanation: The best answer is B.
Smoke shops are typically head shops or novelty stores that sell a wide variety of products, including smoking accessories like bongs. While some states have laws regulating the sale of certain smoking products, smoke shops often operate outside of these regulations due to their diverse product offerings and business model. This allows them to cater to customers seeking smoking accessories while also providing other products such as tobacco, e-cigarettes, and head shops. The head shop model enables the distribution and marketing of smoking products, making it easier for smoke shops to sell bongs and other related items.

Regulatory distinctions, varying state laws governing adult use, and lobbying efforts all contribute to the scope of allowed sales in certain states but not others.","Next time you go there, look for a sign. There will be one saying ""For Tobacco Use Only"" While bongs are commonly associated with marijuana, they are also used for tobacco and in that regard are perfectly legal. By saying they're only for tobacco it protects the stores from the drug laws you mention. So in order for there to be any legal consequences, people would have to prove that the shop is knowingly selling them for use with marijuana and not tobacco. This is impossible to prove in almost every case.",25.90885448,success,2025-11-13T20:05:16.800654,,25.45370864868164,0.25112107623318386,0.0,0.12556053811659193

Hot water is often used for various purposes such as bathing, showering, and washing clothes. The hot water supply may also be supplemented with cold water from nearby sources to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the hotel. Additionally, some hotels may have advanced systems in place to conserve energy and reduce water consumption, such as low-flow showerheads and toilets.","While all buildings are a little different, most use a single boiler and a recirculating hot water system.

228,How do pornography sites stay in business?,"Monetization strategies, high demand, and competitive landscape are key factors that help pornography sites stay in business.

a) Monetization Strategies: Pornography sites use various monetization strategies to generate revenue, such as advertising, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, and subscription-based models. They also offer premium content or membership programs to attract higher-paying users.

b) High Demand: The demand for pornography is high globally, driven by cultural and social factors. This demand creates a lucrative market for pornography sites.

c) Competitive Landscape: The pornography industry is highly competitive, with many sites operating in the same niche. To stay competitive, sites must continuously innovate and improve their content, user experience, and monetization strategies to attract and retain users.

d) Adapting to Changing Regulations: Pornography sites must also adapt to changing regulations and laws regarding online content, such as those related to age verification, data protection, and copyright infringement.

e) Diversification Strategies: Some pornography sites have diversified their offerings by creating niche sites or platforms that cater to specific interests or demographics, such as LGBTQ+ sites or fetish sites. This diversification helps them attract a broader audience and reduce dependence on a single revenue stream.

f) Building User Engagement: Pornography sites must also focus on building user engagement through interactive features, social sharing, and community-building initiatives to retain users and encourage repeat visits.

g) Investing in Technology: Finally, pornography sites invest heavily in technology to improve their infrastructure, security, and user experience, ensuring a smooth and secure online experience for users.","For the same reason Youtube is allowed to exist.

231,"How and Why exactly does encryption work? Dont you need to transfer the key, and couldnt (lets say the NSA) not simply obtain it by saving all your internet activity?","Encryption is indeed based on the concept of symmetry and the use of mathematical transformations to alter data without changing its original form. Here's how it works in more detail:

1. **Key Generation**: When you want to encrypt a message, you need to generate a secret key that will be used for decryption later. This key is usually generated randomly and kept confidential.

2. **Encryption Process**: To encrypt a message, the sender uses the public key (which can be shared publicly) to transform the plaintext (the original message) into ciphertext (the encrypted message). The encryption process involves a series of mathematical transformations, such as substitution, transposition, and permutation, that alter the data without changing its original form.

3. **Symmetry**: Symmetry is a property of an object that can be divided into identical parts, with no change in shape or structure. In the context of encryption, symmetry refers to the fact that the ciphertext is identical to the plaintext when the same operations are applied to both. This means that if you know the key, you can easily reverse-engineer the encryption process and decrypt the message.

4. **Key Exchange**: To ensure secure communication, it's essential to establish a secure key exchange between the sender and receiver. One common approach is to use public-key cryptography, where the sender uses their public key to encrypt the message, and the receiver uses their private key to decrypt it. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the encrypted message.

5. **Secure Communication**: Once the message is encrypted, it's transmitted over an insecure channel (e.g., the internet). To prevent eavesdropping or interception, encryption algorithms like AES use techniques such as padding and authentication to ensure the integrity of the data.

6. **Decryption**: When the receiver receives the ciphertext, they can use their private key to decrypt it and recover the original plaintext message.","Nope, because of the magic of asymmetric cryptography. The short version is that the key used to *encrypt* the data is not the same as the one to *decrypt* it. When Alice sends something to Bob, she encrypts it with his *public* key. This is a key that everyone has the right to see and access. Only Bob, who has the only copy of his *private* key, can then decrypt the message. He then sends a reply, encrypting with Alice's public key, and she decrypts with her private key. The same sort of thing happens with an SSL transaction (HTTPS). When you connect to a secure site, you know you have the right site because they have a certificate proving they are who they say they are. That certificate is also the public key, so you send the data encrypted with that key, and only that site can decrypt it. The site sets up a special session key to encrypt the rest of the data, so you and the site can continue to talk encrypted without anybody else being able to view the contents of the traffic.",34.88365531,success,2025-11-13T20:07:51.660954,,7.904367446899414,0.4294234592445328,0.11177644710578842,0.2067594433399602

Thermal energy is a measure of the total energy associated with particles in a substance, while temperature directly measures the average kinetic energy of those particles.","At a basic level you can think of temperature as the average molecular energy of a system. Temperature can be measured in different ways, but they all come down to measuring changes in heat energy (molecular motion and jiggling).  In everyday thermometers, what is measured is how a liquid (originally mercury) expands with temperature, travelling up the bulb. The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder.  In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely.  There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off.

233,Why is it such a big deal that it costs more than 1 cent to make a penny? Shouldn't the cost and production of other coins and bills counteract the defecit of making pennies?,"It is not entirely accurate to say that the cost and production of other coins and bills counteract the deficit of making pennies. While it's true that global demand from other countries helps keep prices low for U.S. currency, there are several factors contributing to the cost of producing pennies that cannot be easily offset by lower demand or other currencies. These include the use of copper content in the currency, which is more expensive than base metals used for other coins and bills; the complexity of the minting process, including stamping, punching, and polishing; and central bank policies, economic factors, and regulatory requirements that influence production costs. Therefore, while it may seem counterintuitive, the combination of these factors ensures that pennies remain relatively cheap despite being one of the most expensive to produce.","Just because you CAN make up a loss in one are with a gain in another doesn't justify that loss.

235,Why are denim jeans both stiflingly uncomfortable in hot weather and freezing in cold weather?,"Denim's unique combination of natural properties makes it unsuitable for both hot and cold weather conditions.

In hot weather, denim's thick and dense weave traps heat, causing the fabric to retain warmth. Additionally, denim is made from cotton, a natural fiber that absorbs moisture, leading to increased humidity and discomfort.

On the other hand, in cold weather, denim's thickness and weave can make it feel suffocatingly warm. The fabric's insulation properties prevent heat from escaping, causing the wearer to overheat and feel uncomfortable.

Furthermore, denim's natural fibers tend to shrink and lose their shape when exposed to high temperatures or moisture, leading to a tight, constricting fit that can be particularly challenging in hot weather.

In contrast, cold-weather fabrics like wool or fleece are designed to trap warm air next to the skin, providing excellent insulation while keeping the wearer cozy.

238,How do hair transplants work?,"I can't answer that.
A hair transplant is a surgical procedure in which hair follicles are transplanted from one part of the body to another. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:
1. **Scalp mapping**: The surgeon creates a detailed map of the scalp, identifying areas with the most suitable hair growth patterns and potential donor sites.
2. **Donor site selection**: The surgeon selects healthy areas on the back or sides of the head, typically above the ears, for the transplant. These areas have a high concentration of hair follicles that are likely to grow in the desired direction.
3. **Incision**: A small incision is made in the donor site, and the hair follicles are gently dissected from their original location using specialized instruments.
4. **Follicle extraction**: The extracted follicles are then processed to remove any damaged or compromised cells, leaving only healthy ones.
5. **Transplantation**: The processed follicles are then transplanted into the recipient site, which is typically in the back or sides of the head. The surgeon uses a specialized tool to gently push the follicles into place, securing them in their new location.
6. **Post-procedure care**: After the transplant, the patient is advised on how to care for the transplanted area, including avoiding direct sunlight and using gentle hair care products. Recovery time typically ranges from 2-6 weeks, during which time the patient may experience some discomfort or swelling at the donor site.
7. **Recovery**: The recovery process involves regular follow-up appointments with the surgeon to ensure the transplanted area is healing properly. Patients can usually return to their normal activities within a few days, but it's essential to follow the surgeon's instructions carefully to minimize complications and ensure optimal results.","Hair from the back and side of your own head is used.

240,Why some people would rather help an animal than a human?,"Because of the strong emotional connections that can be formed between humans and animals, many individuals prefer helping animals over humans for several reasons.

Some people may feel a stronger sense of responsibility towards animals, as they are often seen as more innocent and vulnerable than humans. This can lead to a greater desire to help them in need.

Additionally, the emotional bond that forms between humans and animals can create a strong motivation to assist them, especially if the animal is in distress or requires care and support.

Furthermore, some individuals may be motivated by a sense of empathy for the suffering or pain they experience in their own lives. Helping an animal can provide a way to redirect emotions towards something positive and meaningful, rather than focusing on personal problems.

Overall, the emotional connection that people form with animals can play a significant role in why some individuals would rather help them over humans.","Speaking personally, animals seem more helpless and innocent.

242,"Air pressure in houses? Why do some doors hit a cushion of air when they close, some doors slam when they close, and some doors get sucked closed?","The cushion of air created by the movement of the door against the frame and the surrounding air when it closes helps to reduce the force required for closing, making some doors easier to open than others. This is why some doors hit a cushion of air when they close, while others slam shut or get sucked closed due to differences in their design and construction.

The main reason for this variation is the pressure difference between inside and outside the house. Air pressure inside a house is typically lower than outside due to the sealed construction, which means that the door creates a cushion of air behind it when closing. This cushion reduces the force required for closure, making some doors easier to open.

On the other hand, if a door is not properly designed or constructed, it may create more pressure inside the house compared to outside, leading to a harder time closing. In such cases, the door might slam shut or get sucked closed due to the increased pressure difference between inside and outside.",It's depends on how air tight the room is. You will notice this with doors that are tighter to the carpet and not under cut. Take a door that you can't slam because of this and open a window in that room the air will be forced out the window and the door will close easier. Opening or closing a door rapidly will generate lots of air movement. Without somewhere to go it will be more difficult to close. Undercut doors allow air underneath.

252,"How come—when looking at the light produced on earth VIA satellite imagery, they are always yellow, when in fact, there are lights of all different colors being produced?","The colors visible in satellite imagery are determined by the type of light emitted by objects on Earth. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering. As a result, the sky appears blue during the daytime due to the scattered light from these molecules. However, when it gets dark, the atmosphere cools, and the temperature drops, causing the Earth's surface to heat up. This increased temperature causes longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, to be emitted more strongly, resulting in a warmer sky at night. The color palette of satellite images can vary depending on the time of day, weather conditions, and atmospheric particles, which can scatter or absorb certain wavelengths of light, producing different colors. For example, clouds can appear white because they reflect all wavelengths of light equally, while dust and pollution can produce brown or gray hues due to their absorption of shorter wavelengths. The Earth's surface temperature varies greatly between day and night, with temperatures ranging from -50°C to 40°C (-58°F to 104°F), which affects the colors visible in satellite imagery.","It's not VIA, it's just via, a word. :-) Anyhow, the answer is simple: most electric lights are actually yellow, so when you look at a lot of lights grouped together from far away, you see mostly yellow light.",33.98428297,success,2025-11-13T20:20:22.741633,,11.219882011413574,0.12451361867704279,0.00784313725490196,0.07003891050583658
253,"Why is insurance handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government?","The primary reason insurance is handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government is due to a combination of factors, including risk management and economic incentives.

Risk Management: By allowing private companies to handle insurance, governments can transfer some of the risks associated with providing healthcare services to the market. This allows companies to take on more risk, as they are incentivized to minimize their costs and maximize profits. In contrast, government-provided insurance often involves higher taxes or premiums, which can lead to inefficiencies and reduced competitiveness.

Economic Incentives: Private insurance companies are motivated by economic incentives, such as maximizing profits and minimizing losses. They are also subject to market forces, including competition and consumer demand. This allows them to respond quickly to changes in the market and adjust their pricing and services accordingly. Government-provided insurance, on the other hand, is often subject to bureaucratic inefficiencies and may not be able to respond as quickly or effectively to changing market conditions.

Other factors, such as the role of government regulation and the availability of alternative funding sources, also play a role in shaping the insurance industry. However, risk management and economic incentives are two key drivers that have contributed to the dominance of private, for-profit insurance companies in the healthcare sector.","> and that's definitely not who I would want backing me if I get in an accident. ...except that, unless you were criminally stupid when signing a contract, in this particular case you get to sue them, i.e. get the government involved.

","Salt water pools still use chlorine, the difference is that the chlorine is produced through electrolysis using the salt as the base material. The advantage is that the salt electrolysis process creates free chlorine ions (the type of chlorine that kills bacteria) and burns off chloramines (the type of chlorine that burns your eyes and smells like strong bleach). As long as they are maintained they will work just as well at killing bacteria, and people tend to find them less irritating, especially if they have sensitive skin.

256,"Why did I just pay $250 for a passport with a 3-week turnaround, when a driver's license is $25 and take 30 minutes?","processing_time
Explanation: The key point here is that the cost of a passport is directly related to its processing time. A 3-week turnaround for a passport indicates a much longer processing time compared to a driver's license, which can be processed in just 30 minutes. This difference in processing time is what results in the significant cost difference between the two documents.

aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights to provide safety by illuminating their surroundings, especially in low-light conditions such as during takeoff and landing. This helps pilots to see the runway, other aircraft, and obstacles, reducing the risk of accidents.

Headlights also contribute to visibility for air traffic control (ATC) and other aircraft, allowing them to navigate safely through controlled airspace. Additionally, headlights can be used to increase safety in emergency situations such as engine failure or system malfunctions.

While regulatory requirements may have played a role in the adoption of headlighting on aeroplanes/airplanes, their primary purpose is indeed safety and visibility. Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States have established standards for aircraft lighting to ensure compliance with safety regulations.","> Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights?

Airborne dispersal is also not directly related to the spread through a wound. Instead, it's more commonly associated with respiratory infections like tuberculosis or influenza.

Therefore, the best answer is contaminated contact through airborne dispersal.","Generally through the blood stream or the lymphatic vessels. When a contagion attacks a specific organ I.e. Hepatitis, it is because something about those cells allows that particular pathogen to attack/reproduce better than they do in other cells.

284,"If there are concentration camps in North Korea that are similar to those found in Germany during WWII, why hasn't a military force such as NATO intervened?","While it is true that the situation in North Korea shares some similarities with the concentration camps in Nazi Germany during WWII, there are several reasons why a military intervention by NATO or other international forces has not occurred despite diplomatic efforts and China's influence. Here are a few key points to consider:*   **North Korea's authoritarian regime**: The Kim regime is notoriously repressive and has shown little willingness to engage with the outside world in a constructive manner. This has made it difficult for any diplomatic efforts to bear fruit, as the regime has consistently rejected international pressure and cooperation.*   **Limited economic incentives**: Unlike during WWII, North Korea's economy is not driven by significant trade or investment from Western countries. The regime's primary focus is on maintaining its own isolated economy, which makes it less likely to be swayed by economic incentives for intervention.*   **China's influence**: While China has historically been a key player in North Korea's politics and economy, its influence has waxed and waned over time. During the Cold War era, China was more willing to engage with the West, but since the 1990s, it has largely shifted its focus to regional security issues in East Asia.*   **NATO's deterrence strategy**: NATO's primary concern is maintaining a balance of power in Europe and preventing any single state from dominating the region. Given North Korea's status as a nuclear-armed state with a significant military advantage, NATO's deterrence strategy focuses on containing its expansionist ambitions rather than intervening militarily.*   **International law and humanitarian concerns**: The international community has established clear norms and principles regarding human rights, humanitarian intervention, and the protection of civilians. However, these norms have been largely ignored in North Korea's case, which has led to widespread condemnation and calls for action from the international community.*   **Lack of a viable alternative**: In contrast to Nazi Germany during WWII, where the Allies were able to establish a coalition government and implement policies that addressed the country's grievances, North Korea's authoritarian regime lacks a viable alternative to its current system. The regime has shown little willingness to reform or democratize, making it difficult for any interventionist efforts to succeed.*   **Military constraints**: Finally, the military capabilities of NATO member states are not sufficient to take on the scale and complexity of a conflict with North Korea. While NATO's military capabilities have improved significantly since WWII, they remain focused on regional security issues rather than large-scale conflicts like those in North Korea.","This is asked a lot, but here it goes.

289,Why do you often feel to hot/cold when you want to sleep?,"It's a combination of several factors, but here are the main reasons why you often feel hot or cold when trying to sleep:

1. **Body Temperature Regulation**: Your body temperature naturally fluctuates throughout the day and night. When it's hot outside, your body tries to cool down by sweating, which can make you feel hotter. In contrast, when it's cold, your body tries to warm up by shivering, which can make you feel colder.

2. **Sleep Stage**: During different stages of sleep, your body temperature changes. For example, during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, your body temperature drops slightly, while during non-REM sleep, it remains relatively stable. This change in temperature can affect how you feel when trying to fall asleep or stay asleep.

3. **Sleep Environment**: The environment around you can significantly impact your sleep and body temperature. For example, a room with a consistent temperature, humidity, and air circulation can promote better sleep. On the other hand, a room that is too hot or cold can disrupt your sleep patterns.

4. **Clothing and Bedding**: Wearing light, breathable clothing and using warm bedding can help regulate your body temperature and improve sleep quality. Conversely, wearing heavy or thick clothing, such as blankets, can make you feel hotter and more uncomfortable.

5. **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism, anemia, or hypothyroidism, can affect body temperature regulation and lead to hot flashes or night sweats during sleep. Additionally, some medications, such as those used to treat depression or high blood pressure, can also impact body temperature and sleep quality.

Why aren't all purchases/mergers viewed as a consolidation within an industry and a step closer to monopolization?,"The law allows companies to purchase or merge with other companies due to various reasons, including the promotion of competition, innovation, and economic growth. However, not all purchases/mergers are viewed as consolidation within an industry and a step closer to monopolization for several reasons:

1. **Regulatory frameworks:** Different regulatory bodies have varying definitions and guidelines for what constitutes a merger or acquisition. These frameworks can lead to inconsistencies in enforcement and interpretation.

2. **Industry-specific characteristics:** Industries with unique characteristics, such as high barriers to entry, limited competition, or critical infrastructure, may be more likely to be consolidated due to the benefits of increased efficiency and reduced costs.

3. **Economic factors:** The economic environment can influence the likelihood of consolidation. In times of economic downturn, companies may be more willing to merge or purchase other companies to reduce costs and improve profitability.

4. **Lobbying and market forces:** Companies, investors, and other stakeholders often engage in lobbying efforts to influence regulatory decisions and shape industry norms. This can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of consolidation, where companies feel pressure to merge or acquire others to stay competitive.

5. **Jurisdictional differences:** The laws governing mergers and acquisitions vary across countries and jurisdictions, which can create challenges for companies operating globally.

6. **Public perception and social impact:** Consolidation can have significant social and economic impacts on communities, particularly if it leads to reduced competition or increased prices. Regulatory bodies may be reluctant to approve mergers that could harm consumers or the broader economy.",Having a monopoly is not inherently bad or illegal.

296,Why does smoking preserve food?,"4. smoking chambers
 Controlled environment 
 Direct exposure to smoke and heat can help preserve food by reducing bacterial growth, preventing spoilage, and enhancing flavor retention. This is because the controlled conditions within a smoking chamber allow for precise temperature and humidity control, creating an optimal environment for food preservation. The direct exposure to smoke helps to break down proteins and fats, making nutrients more bioavailable, while the controlled environment minimizes the risk of contamination and spoilage. Additionally, the Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars, occurs when food is exposed to heat and smoke, resulting in the formation of new flavor compounds and browning. This process enhances the overall quality and aroma of the preserved food.

 Therefore, the correct answer is smoking chambers. 
","Smoking by itself is actually insufficient to properly preserve foods. Smoke is an antimicrobial and an antioxidant but only protects the outside of food, so it is usually combined with other processes like salt-curing and drying which protect the interior of food from bacterial growth.",32.83289003,success,2025-11-13T20:55:56.359839,,30.12354278564453,0.24277456647398846,0.023391812865497075,0.17341040462427745

When you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look up, why does everything seem to be wavy? The answer lies in two main factors: motion parallax and motion-induced blur. Motion parallax refers to the apparent displacement of objects when viewed from different angles or distances. This is due to the way our brains process visual information and create a sense of depth. When you look at a moving pattern, your brain interprets the movement as if it were coming from behind you, creating a sense of depth and distance. However, this creates a blurred effect on the pattern itself, making it appear wavy or distorted. This is known as motion-induced blur. The combination of these two factors - motion parallax and motion-induced blur - contributes to the perceived movement of the pattern, making it seem wavy when you look at it for an extended period of time. So, in short, your brain's interpretation of the moving pattern creates a sense of depth and distance, which is then distorted by the blurred effect, resulting in the apparent wavy appearance. Well done on understanding this concept!  }  .<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>","This is due to how the movement is processed in the brain. Very basically, there are certain neurons that are firing in response to the moving pattern. The moving pattern is constant, so they are firing continuously. When you look away those same cells continue to fire because they've been doing so for however long you were looking at it. Your brain knows that the moving pattern is no longer in focus, but it still takes a bit to inhibit the neurons and stop them from firing.

301,Why do we drink cow's milk instead of human milk?,"Selective breeding
Lactase persistence is a key factor in the widespread adoption of cow's milk over human milk.
Human infants are born with the ability to digest lactose, but this ability is lost as they age due to the action of an enzyme called lactase. However, many humans retain the ability to produce and digest lactase into adulthood, allowing them to consume lactose-containing foods like milk without issue. This is not the case for most people, who are unable to digest lactose and must consume dairy products in limited amounts or avoid them altogether.

Cow's milk has been selectively bred over thousands of years to be high in protein and fat while low in lactose, making it easier for humans to digest. Additionally, cow's milk contains casein, a protein that is not found in human milk, which can help to break down the proteins in cow's milk and make them more easily digestible.

The widespread adoption of cow's milk over human milk has been driven by selective breeding, as well as cultural and economic factors. In many parts of the world, cow's milk is a staple food and is often consumed at an early age, leading to a higher incidence of lactose intolerance in humans who are not exposed to it from birth.

In contrast, human milk has been selectively bred for its nutritional content and palatability, but not necessarily for its digestibility. As a result, many humans have evolved to be able to digest cow's milk without issue, while still retaining the ability to digest human milk as an infant.","Human females can't produce the same quantities of milk that female cows can. It wouldn't be very profitable. Plus, notice that we mostly drink milk that comes from animals that like to graze on grass, like cows, goat, and sheep.

306,"Why is it taking them so long to come out with the oculus rift consumer version, when they developed it nearly a year ago, and came out with the development kits nearly two years before that?","There are several reasons why it's taking Oculus to release the consumer version of the Oculus Rift, despite developing it nearly a year ago and coming out with development kits nearly two years before that. Here are some possible explanations:
1. **Complexity of the device**: The Oculus Rift is a complex device with advanced hardware and software capabilities, requiring significant resources and time to develop high-quality VR experiences.
2. **Industry standards and regulations**: Ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations can be a time-consuming process, especially for a new technology like VR.
3. **Market demand and competition**: The market for VR headsets is highly competitive, and Oculus may need to balance the demand for their products with the need to differentiate themselves from competitors.
4. **Business model and revenue streams**: Oculus may be exploring different business models or revenue streams that don't require a consumer version of the Rift immediately, such as licensing or subscription-based services.
5. **Manufacturing and production complexities**: Producing high-quality VR headsets requires specialized manufacturing processes and equipment, which can add to the development time.
6. **Testing and certification**: Thorough testing and certification procedures are necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of a consumer-grade VR headset, which can be a time-consuming process.
7. **Development processes**: Oculus may be refining their development processes or iterating on existing ones before releasing a consumer version, which can take time.
8. **Partnerships and collaborations**: Oculus may be working with partners or collaborators to develop the consumer version of the Rift, which can add complexity to the development process.
9. **Patent and intellectual property issues**: Oculus may need to resolve patent and intellectual property issues related to their technology before releasing a consumer version.
10. **Timing and strategy**: Oculus may be choosing to release the consumer version at a specific time or in response to market conditions, rather than immediately following development of the device.","My thoughts are because it is supposed to be a game changer(literally) and to release anything sub par could potentially hurt the concept and make it take even longer for people to get interested in it again, I for one would be extremely disappointed if it was clunky and didn't work as good as I'm imagining it will.",50.47136354,success,2025-11-13T21:08:31.797869,,8.483633041381836,0.12010443864229764,0.010498687664041995,0.0731070496083551

312,How did the idea of weekends come to be?,"The idea of weekends came about through a combination of social, economic, and technological changes that transformed work patterns and leisure activities in Western cultures.

1. The term 'weekend' was first used in the 16th century to describe a period of rest after a long week.
2. Sundays were initially considered a day of rest, but as the working week became more rigid, people began to seek out alternative days for leisure and relaxation.
3. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in work patterns, with workers moving from rural areas to cities and factories becoming increasingly mechanized.
4. Factory owners and managers recognized the need for employees to have time off during the week, leading to the creation of a new concept: the weekend.
5. The association between Saturday and the weekend became particularly strong in Western cultures due to factors such as the rise of urbanization, the growth of industry, and the development of new leisure activities like sports and entertainment.","Henry Ford has been credited with creating the weekend as we know it today. Apparently the normal work week used to be six days, and Sunday was the day of rest. When Ford was paying workers $2 per day (maybe $2.50, not sure), the going rate at the time, there was lots of turnover and constant hiring and training, so Ford decided to double the rate to $5 per day to reduce turnover and keep employees instead of constantly training new hires. At the same time, he also decided to make a five day work week to give his employees Saturday off, thinking they would buy more cars to ride around in for the weekend. The local business community told him he would bankrupt his business. The day after he ran a full page ad in the paper for the $5 per day jobs, there were massive lines of people applying for jobs with Ford. The idea was extremely successful, and the weekend was born.",48.64244175,success,2025-11-13T21:12:58.827387,,15.163408279418945,0.3829787234042553,0.055045871559633024,0.18844984802431614

315,How is it possible to program a computer? How can a clunk of metal understand lines of code?,"A computer can be programmed through a series of steps involving the creation, translation, and execution of instructions. Here's how it works:

1. **High-Level Programming Languages**: Programmers write high-level languages such as Python, Java, or C++ that are easier to understand and modify.
2. **Compilation**: The high-level code is translated into machine code by a compiler, which converts the syntax of the language into binary instructions.
3. **Assembly Language**: The compiled machine code is then converted into assembly language, which is closer to machine code but still not executable directly by the computer.
4. **Binary Code**: Finally, the assembly language is translated into binary code, which is a series of 0s and 1s that the computer's processor can understand.
5. **Execution**: The binary code is executed by the computer's processor, which decodes the instructions and carries out the desired actions.
6. **Input/Output**: The program also includes input/output statements to interact with the user or other devices, such as reading data from a keyboard or displaying output on a screen.
7. **Testing and Debugging**: Once the program is complete, it's tested for errors and debugged to ensure it works correctly.

A clunk of metal, in this context, refers to an inanimate object that executes instructions encoded in binary codes. It can be thought of as a computer's processor or central processing unit (CPU).

The process of programming involves writing high-level languages, compiling them into machine code, and then translating the assembly language into binary code. This allows the computer to understand and execute the instructions.

In summary, programming is a complex process that involves multiple steps, from high-level programming languages to execution and testing. The clunk of metal, or processor, plays a crucial role in executing these instructions and making the computer work.

Key Takeaways:
* Programming involves writing high-level languages and translating them into machine code.
* The compilation step converts high-level code into assembly language, which is closer to machine code.
* Binary code is the final form of the program that the computer's processor can understand.
* A clunk of metal (processor) executes instructions encoded in binary codes and makes the computer work.",Computers run off of binary code which is basically a bunch of 0's and 1's.

316,How is it possible that we are able to find planets far away form the Earth (like Kepler-186 f or PSR B1257+12) but we don’t know if there are other planets in our solar system?,"4. bias
The main reason we don't know about other planets in our solar system is due to the bias in how we detect and study them. Here's why:
1. Distance: As you get farther away from Earth, the light it takes to reach us gets weaker and longer to travel. This makes it harder to detect faint signals like those from distant planets.
2. Sensitivity: The sensitivity of our telescopes and detection methods is also limited by their distance from Earth. At great distances, the signal-to-noise ratio (the difference between the signal and noise) is lower, making it harder to detect.
3. Interference: The universe is filled with various forms of interference, such as light from nearby stars, radio waves, and other sources that can mask or distort signals from distant planets. This makes it even more challenging to detect them.
4. Bias: Finally, there's a bias in how we study the solar system. We tend to focus on objects that are closest to us, like the inner planets, and overlook those at greater distances. This is known as the 'inner-outer' bias, where we prioritize studying what's nearby over what's farther away.","The way we find these planets is to monitor the amount of light coming from a star and then see if it drops slightly occasionally. If it does then that means the star is partially obscured by a planet transiting across the front of it.  We do not have that perspective on planets beyond the orbit of earth as there is nothing bright for them to obscure. We cannot see them with telescopes because they are too dark and/or distant to detect, the best we can do is look for slight changes in the orbit of objects we can see (such as Pluto) to see if they are being affected by the gravity of something unknown.",46.22892833,success,2025-11-13T21:18:21.933169,,10.909140586853027,0.34591194968553457,0.012658227848101266,0.17610062893081763

Now container A has 90.91 units of liquid A, and 9.09 units of B. However, container B still has the same proportion of liquid A and B after the first mixing - namely, 10/110 liquid A, and 100/110 liquid B.

2. Cold-pressing or extraction methods are used to extract juice without heat, preserving its natural flavor and nutrients.
3. Minimal processing helps retain the fruit's natural characteristics and prevents degradation of its taste and nutritional value.
4. Standardized production processes ensure consistency across batches and products, allowing for a consistent taste.
5. Quality control measures are essential in detecting any deviations from the desired taste, enabling corrective actions to be taken promptly.
6. Innovative packaging can enhance the appearance and aroma of the product, making it more appealing to consumers.

323,"When people talk to animals or babies, why do they tend to talk in a high pitched cutsie manner, and never talk like they would normally?","To understand why people tend to speak in a high-pitched cutie manner when talking to animals or babies, we must consider the complexities of human communication and animal cognition. When interacting with these species, humans often employ emotional connections and empathetic tones to convey affection and understanding. This is rooted in the way our brains process language and the emotions it evokes. By using high-pitched tones, humans can create a sense of warmth and nurturing, which is essential for building trust and establishing a positive relationship with animals or babies. The cutie manner is a result of this emotional resonance, making it easier for both parties to connect on an intuitive level. In contrast, when speaking normally, humans tend to use lower-pitched tones, which can come across as more formal or even intimidating. This difference in tone may be due to the varying levels of emotional investment and attachment that humans have towards animals or babies, leading them to adjust their communication style accordingly.","The heck where are the comments?  The behavior is called mirroring which we humans have accepted as affectionate behavior. When babies babble in their cute high pitch voices, we also babble back.  When cats miaow, we miaow back.

1. **Archived threads are still accessible via permalink**: Twitter stores archived content, including deleted tweets, in their database. This means that even though the tweet itself is no longer visible on the platform, its contents (including any replies or retweets) remain available through a permalink.

2. **Deleted comments can't be accessed due to abuse prevention**: When you delete a comment, Twitter flags it as potentially abusive and removes it from view.

325,Why do big bags of chips have zero trans fats but the smaller version of the exact same chips contains trans fats?,"The lack of explicit guidance on labeling for trans fats allows manufacturers to opt out, leading to a lower risk of contamination.

 Critique_of_Lack Of_Transparency_And_Accountability: This answer is partially correct. The lack of explicit guidance on labeling for trans fats does allow manufacturers to self-certify their products as 'trans fat-free', which can be misleading and potentially harmful. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to a situation where manufacturers are not held accountable for the presence or absence of trans fats in their products, despite regulatory requirements.

 A more accurate answer would be: The lack of explicit guidance on labeling for trans fats allows manufacturers to self-certify their products as 'trans fat-free', which can be misleading and potentially harmful. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to a situation where manufacturers are not held accountable for the presence or absence of trans fats in their products, despite regulatory requirements.

The lack of explicit guidance on labeling for trans fats allows manufacturers to self-certify their products as 'trans fat-free', which can be misleading and potentially harmful.

 A more comprehensive answer would acknowledge the limitations of the current system while also highlighting the need for stronger regulations and enforcement to ensure transparency and accountability in the food industry.","Because according to FDA regulations, any foods that has 0.5 g of trans fat or less PER SERVING can be labelled as trans fat free. In big bags of chips, the manufacturer can jiggle the serving size so that each serving will have less than 0.5 g.

326,"Why does China, India, ect. have so many more people than the rest of the world?","The correct answer is (5) Cultural attitudes towards having many children.
Explanation: The cultural attitudes of China, India, and other countries have played a significant role in shaping their population growth patterns. In these cultures, having many children is often seen as a desirable trait, and family planning is not as emphasized as it is in Western societies. This has led to higher birth rates and more people overall.

Historical population growth (1) was also a factor, with China and India experiencing rapid population growth in the past century due to improvements in healthcare and living standards. Agricultural development (2) has also contributed to population growth, as it allows for increased food production and support for larger families. However, these factors alone do not fully explain the significant difference in population size between these countries and the rest of the world.

Limited access to education and family planning (3) is another important factor, but it is a more complex issue that requires further exploration. While limited access to education can lead to lower birth rates, family planning is often stigmatized or unavailable in many of these cultures, making it difficult for people to control their fertility.

Economic development (4) has also played a role, as higher incomes and economic growth have enabled people to afford larger families. However, this factor is not unique to China and India, and other countries with high levels of economic development are still experiencing rapid population growth.","Fertile river valleys that create a lot of good agricultural land.

341,How are wells built?,"The process of building a well involves several steps, including site selection and drilling. Here's a more detailed overview of the key points involved in building a well:

1. **Site Selection**: The first step in building a well is to select a suitable location for the well. This includes considering factors such as water availability, soil type, and environmental concerns. The site should be chosen based on its suitability for the intended use of the well (e.g., residential, agricultural, or industrial).

2. **Drilling**: Once the site has been selected, drilling is the next step. Drilling involves creating a hole in the ground to access the water table or aquifer. The drill bit is inserted into the ground and rotated to create a hole of the desired depth. The well is then cased with a casing pipe to prevent collapse and ensure the safe flow of water.

3. **Casing and Cementing**: After drilling, the well is cased with a casing pipe to line the interior of the well. The casing pipe is typically made of steel or PVC and is cemented in place to prevent leaks and ensure the integrity of the well.

4. **Completion**: Finally, the well is completed by installing any necessary equipment, such as pumps, filters, or treatment systems. This step ensures that the well is functioning properly and efficiently.

5. **Testing and Maintenance**: After completion, the well is tested to ensure it is functioning correctly and safely. Regular maintenance is also essential to prevent issues and extend the life of the well.","Wells are not technically built, they are drilled.  In reference to a water well, a company will do some research to see if they can drill a well in the desired area. This all depends on location, ground type, and various other things. If a well is drillable they will bring out a truck, that is basically a small oil derrick, and begin drilling the well. Depending on you location and ground type the depth of the well will vary.  Some places have underground ""rivers"" and can be relatively shallow wells, on the other had, some need to be deeper so that more water will seep into the vacant area that is created by the drilling.

Nucleation is reversible. As water molecules attach themselves to cluster, other molecules are leaving. There is a point called the *critical nuclear size*, at which point the cluster of water molecules is stable. This is the point at which a raindrop forms. The critical nuclear size /critical radius is controlled by temperature. The mathematics tells us that as the temperature is lowered, the critical radius decreases.

349,Why are textbooks so expensive?,"I can't provide a definitive answer to this question, but I can offer some insights on the complex factors that contribute to textbook prices.

Textbook prices are influenced by various factors, including production costs, research and development, distribution and marketing, profit margins, market demand, licensing fees, quality and durability, educational institution subsidies, and government regulations.

Production costs, such as labor, materials, and printing expenses, can significantly impact the final price of textbooks. Research and development expenses also play a role in creating new and innovative content.

Distribution and marketing efforts by publishers and retailers contribute to the overall cost of textbooks. Profit margins are another crucial factor, as publishers aim to make a profit on each book sale.

Market demand for textbooks can also affect prices, with higher demand leading to increased costs and lower prices. Licensing fees from educational institutions or other organizations may also add to the expense.

Quality and durability of textbooks can impact their cost, with more expensive options often featuring better materials and construction. Educational institution subsidies can help reduce textbook costs for these institutions.

Government regulations, such as those related to environmental sustainability or intellectual property protection, may influence textbook production and pricing.

In summary, the prices of textbooks are influenced by a complex interplay of various factors, making it challenging to pinpoint a single reason for their expense.","Because only a small number are printed. If you print a million of something, the costs are divided across that large number and it can be cheaper.

356,"How comes different phone chargers take widely different time to charge the same phone,despite all being rated 5V 1A?","Despite being rated 5V 1A, different phone chargers can take widely different time to charge the same phone due to various factors that affect power delivery efficiency, voltage regulation, and device compatibility.

Power delivery efficiency is a critical factor in determining charging time. Different charger designs can vary significantly in their ability to deliver power efficiently, leading to differences in charging speed.

Voltage regulation, current limiting, and device compatibility also play important roles in shaping the observed variations in charging times.

In addition, other factors such as cable quality, connector type, and phone model can also impact the charging time. For example, some phones may require a specific voltage or current level to charge efficiently, while others may be more tolerant of deviations from that standard.

Therefore, it is not surprising that different phone chargers can take widely different time to charge the same phone, even if they are all rated 5V 1A. The actual charging speed will depend on a complex interplay of these factors, making it challenging to predict and compare charging times across different devices.

In summary, while charger ratings may provide a general indication of power delivery efficiency, other critical factors such as voltage regulation, current limiting, and device compatibility can significantly impact the observed variations in charging times.","Chargers also need to tell the phone - in some way - how much power is available. The 1A wall charger provided with your device has the circuitry there to properly communicate with device. The third-party car charger doesn't, so the device might assume it is an overloaded version 1 USB port, and draw the minimum 1/10th of an amp. An interesting point is the Samsung chargers.

357,Why is mace (pepper spray) illegal in the UK?,"The safety concerns and potential harm to individuals, particularly those with pre-existing medical conditions or vulnerable groups, are major factors contributing to the illegality of mace (pepper spray) in the UK.

Safety Concerns: While pepper spray can be an effective deterrent, its use has been linked to unintended consequences such as respiratory issues, eye irritation, and even temporary blindness. The UK government has implemented regulations to minimize these risks and ensure that users are aware of the potential harm.

Public Safety: The use of mace is often associated with aggressive behavior, which can escalate into physical confrontations. By restricting its sale and possession, the UK authorities aim to reduce the risk of violent incidents and promote a safer community.

Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Mace is particularly concerning for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma or heart problems. The UK government has taken measures to restrict access to mace, particularly in public places, to minimize the risk of harm to these vulnerable groups.

Regulations and laws governing pepper spray are primarily enforced by the UK's Police, Public Health England, and the Home Office. These regulations aim to strike a balance between individual rights and public safety concerns.","There is no such concept as ""defensive weapon"" in any of the UK legal systems. Anything carried with the sole or primary intent of causing injury upon another is always considered an offensive weapon in the UK. Note that the perceived intent of usage is important.

362,How does my cat know to look at my eyes/face when communicating something?,"Cats are known to use a range of visual cues, including eye contact and facial expressions, to communicate with their human caregivers and other animals. When it comes to looking at your eyes or face, cats may be trying to convey a specific message, such as attention, affection, or even warning signs. Here are some possible reasons why your cat might be looking at you like this:

1. **Attention seeking**: Cats crave attention and interaction from their human caregivers. By staring at your eyes or face, your cat may be attempting to get your attention and initiate play, conversation, or affection.

2. **Emotional connection**: Cats are highly attuned to emotional cues in their environment, including those from humans. When they look at you with a calm, gentle expression, it may be a sign that they feel comfortable and secure around you.

3. **Social bonding**: In the wild, cats often use visual displays to establish dominance or submission. Your cat may be using eye contact and facial expressions to communicate a sense of social bonding or hierarchy within your household.

4. **Communication of needs**: Cats can also use their eyes and face to convey basic needs, such as hunger, thirst, or the need for attention. If your cat is looking at you with a hungry expression, it may be trying to get your attention and food.

5. **Contextual understanding**: Cats are highly perceptive animals and can pick up on subtle cues in their environment. They may be using eye contact and facial expressions to communicate something specific in the context of their daily routine or interactions with you.","It's been a common thing for workers in parts of the world to have to wear face masks on the back of their head because tigers won't attack if they think a person is looking at them.

364,Why do the body-cells age?,"DNA damage is a primary driver of cellular aging.

Explanation: The body-cells age due to DNA damage, which leads to the accumulation of mutations and epigenetic changes that ultimately result in cellular aging. This process is supported by various scientific studies that have shown a strong correlation between DNA damage and age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Furthermore, epigenetic changes, telomere shortening, oxidative stress, inflammaging, hormonal changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction all contribute to cellular aging. These factors can be triggered by various environmental and lifestyle factors, including exposure to toxins, smoking, and lack of physical activity.

In addition, the accumulation of these age-related factors can lead to a decline in cellular function and an increased risk of age-related diseases. Therefore, it is essential to address these underlying causes of aging to prevent or delay age-related diseases and promote overall health and well-being.","A few reasons. The most straightforward is that every time a cell copies it's DNA, it uses up a piece of the tail at the end of the DNA called the *telomere*.  When a cell is out of telomere, fragments of the DNA itself start getting used and the cell goes into *telomere panic*.

375,Why do Humans (and most mammals) have individual teeth instead of a beak or solid bony structure?,"Dietary specialization
The development of individual teeth in humans (and most mammals) was indeed driven by the need for efficient food processing and manipulation, particularly with regards to crushing and grinding tough plant material. This allowed early humans to exploit new food sources and adapt to changing environments.

Dietary specialization is a key factor that led to the evolution of individual teeth. As humans transitioned from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one centered around agriculture and animal domestication, their diets became more specialized and varied. This shift in diet required new tools and technologies, including the development of sharp, pointed teeth for piercing and tearing food.

In addition, as humans began to consume a wider range of foods, including tough plant material, their teeth evolved to accommodate this new type of food. The development of individual teeth allowed early humans to process and manipulate these foods more efficiently, enabling them to extract nutrients from a variety of sources.

The combination of dietary specialization and the need for efficient food processing and manipulation drove the evolution of individual teeth in humans (and most mammals). This unique dental structure has enabled humans to thrive in a wide range of environments and ecosystems, making it an essential adaptation for our species.","Only reason I can think of is, if one of em breaks, we can still chew",43.58806396,success,2025-11-13T22:14:03.565534,,12.806513786315918,0.035555555555555556,0.0,0.035555555555555556
376,Why do people look away from the point of focus to think?,"To think, people typically divert their gaze away from the point of focus, which is a common phenomenon known as 'divided attention.' This behavior serves several purposes. Firstly, it allows the brain to disengage from the task at hand and engage with other visual stimuli, such as surroundings or distractions. Secondly, it enables individuals to process information more efficiently by reducing cognitive load management. By focusing on different aspects of a scene simultaneously, people can better retain and recall relevant details. Finally, looking away from the point of focus can also help reduce mental fatigue and increase productivity during tasks that require sustained attention.",If you look away there's no stimuli trying to get your attention.

379,"How come humans generally get into cold water slowly and uncomfortably, but animals jump in with no hesitation?","The ability to tolerate cold water in humans is due to the complex process of thermoregulation, which involves multiple mechanisms to maintain body temperature. This includes sweating, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction, as well as the production of antipyretic hormones such as noradrenaline and adrenaline. These mechanisms work together to help regulate body temperature in response to cold water. In contrast, animals have evolved different strategies to quickly acclimate to cold water, often relying on behavioral adaptations such as rapid immersion, diving reflexes, or specialized physiological features like countercurrent heat exchange in some fish species. These adaptations enable them to rapidly cool their bodies and conserve energy during exposure to cold water.","If you think animals are not afraid of water you have never tried to bath a horse or take one through a puddle. lol.

380,"What's the difference between tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons etc?","The primary differences among these terms are their formation mechanisms, size, wind speeds, and impact areas.

Formation Mechanisms:
- Tornadoes form over land when a combination of atmospheric instability and wind shear create a rotating updraft known as a mesocyclone. If the conditions are right, this can touch the ground and become a tornado.
- Hurricanes and typhoons form in warm ocean waters over the tropics and develop into tropical cyclones through a process involving warm water, moisture, and low pressure. They then strengthen as they move over cooler waters or dry air.
- Cyclones are similar to hurricanes but occur in the Indian Ocean and southern Pacific Ocean, and can also be found in other parts of the world where these conditions exist.","All are spinning masses of air. Tornadoes are much smaller than the others being only a matter of yards across. A cyclone is air spinning around a low pressure system and can be used regardless of the size. Cyclone is also used for a violent tropical storm, especially one originating in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or Indian Ocean. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same thing.

383,"Why do they bother to try and ""hide"" cell phone towers?","They bother to try and 'hide' cell phone towers because of a combination of regulatory compliance, security concerns, land use planning and zoning, environmental concerns, business operations needs, and industry standards.

In order to operate legally and meet the demands of their customers, cellular network providers must ensure that they have adequate coverage throughout their service areas. This often requires installing cell phone towers in strategic locations, such as on poles or rooftops, which can be difficult to conceal.

Security concerns also play a role, as cell phone towers can be used for malicious purposes such as hacking and surveillance. By hiding these structures, providers can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and minimize the potential for security breaches.

In terms of land use planning and zoning, cell phone tower installations must comply with local regulations and ordinances. This can involve obtaining permits and approvals from local authorities before construction begins, which can be time-consuming and costly.

Environmental concerns are also a factor, as cell phone towers can have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, they can generate electromagnetic radiation that may interfere with wildlife communication or disrupt natural habitats.

Business operations needs are another reason why providers must hide cell phone towers. They need to ensure that their networks operate efficiently and effectively, which requires a robust infrastructure. By hiding these structures, providers can maintain the integrity of their network and minimize downtime or other disruptions.

Finally, industry standards play a role in determining where and how cell phone towers are installed.

384,Full Faith and Credit in the US,"2
Key Points:
1. Full Faith and Credit is a fundamental principle that ensures each state recognizes and respects the laws and records of other states.
2. Mutual recognition is essential for economic cooperation and stability across state lines.
3. The concept of Full Faith and Credit has been interpreted by the US Supreme Court to include not only the recognition of state laws but also the enforcement of those laws by federal courts.
4. This principle is rooted in the Constitution, specifically Article IV, Section 1, Clause 2, which states that 'full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts of other States, and the Records of every State shall be accepted in all Courts of the United States.'
5. The Full Faith and Credit principle has been used to resolve disputes between states and to ensure consistency in the administration of justice across state lines.
6. It also plays a critical role in facilitating economic cooperation and stability by enabling businesses to operate freely across state borders without fear of conflicting laws or records.
7. However, the principle has also been subject to interpretation and challenge over the years, with some arguing that it can be limited or circumvented through judicial decisions or legislative actions.
8. Despite these challenges, the Full Faith and Credit principle remains an essential aspect of US law and policy, ensuring that states work together in a coordinated and consistent manner to promote economic growth, stability, and cooperation.","US states can't deny the validity of legal documents in other states.

387,Why do we use implants for breast enlargement instead of something biological like stomache fat?,"Breast implants offer several advantages over biological alternatives like stomach fat for breast enlargement. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Safety and Scalability**: Breast implants provide a safer and more scalable option, which is particularly important when it comes to breast augmentation. Biological alternatives can be unpredictable and may not respond as well to the body's natural processes.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Implants are generally more cost-effective than biological alternatives like stomach fat. This makes them an attractive option for individuals who want to enhance their appearance without breaking the bank.

3. **Long-Term Results**: Breast implants can provide long-term results, with many patients experiencing stable and natural-looking outcomes for 10-20 years or more. Biological alternatives, on the other hand, may require repeated surgeries to maintain their shape and size.

4. **Personalized Care**: Implants are designed to be tailored to each individual's unique needs and preferences. This personalized approach ensures that patients receive a customized solution that meets their specific requirements.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Implants are subject to strict regulatory guidelines, which ensure they meet high standards of safety and efficacy. Biological alternatives, while regulated in some countries, may not be subject to the same level of oversight.

Ultimately, whether to use breast implants or biological alternatives like stomach fat depends on individual circumstances, patient expectations, and specific needs.

1. The economic gap is indeed rooted in historical context, including industrialization and technological innovation that have historically benefited the wealthy elite.

2. Structural factors such as income inequality, tax policies, labor market, education, healthcare, housing costs, and access to resources have all played a significant role in widening this gap.

3. The interplay between these historical, structural, and contemporary factors has created a complex economic landscape that affects different segments of the population differently.
